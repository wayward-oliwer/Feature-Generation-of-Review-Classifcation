saw Bourne Ultimatum last summer with friend wow had already seen first two films liked them but Ultimatum loved Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne amnesia suffering CIA agent run trying discover who Like already said loved movie from start finish plot holes slow scenes everything paced just right fit well with other films but all senses much better Best stunts car chases actors effects Ive seen action movie all summer surprisingly due SpiderMan Pirates etc But wasnt just action film Jason doesnt just kill run soul audience feels for him drama included But doesnt slow down all threequels came out last summer best
