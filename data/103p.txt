Having seen CUBE Ive been fan Vincenzo Natalis work Natali seems have inept ability take storyline hardly wring our like wet towel for all storyline can muster Instead lets stories themselves unfold natural ways much fact you may fact believe there Cube were people try escape case NOTHING large empty expanse where there nothing advert had hooked instantly seemed simple Take two characters who one likes send them world where there nothing Natali does simply you forget logic place where there nothing cannot exist fact world nothing becomes something irony within film Theres nothing there but also something there might good time point out trailer highly misleading fortunate enough actually understand film leaned more comedic side than trailer otherwise told Therefore upon watching film laughed every now again whereas someone who advert mislead may find themselves utterly confused may take minute give film some praise where film excels concept genius concept have world nothing put two characters there NOT two brilliant minded characters who will philosophise work out their surroundings but two idiots who have absolutely clue where hell they are Another strong point films cinematography though first may not seem Where each wall north earth south west down just white plane perception depth becomes faulty hard determine where things are placed MisEnScene cinematography many moments where actually happens but for most part camera placed two characters object character are placed foreground background allowing sense depth realised However film does lack certain areas film relatively short but even after while novelty world nothing becomes rather dull you wish find some form resolution within plot can also argue acting once again questionable These two characters are sense unlikeable therefore feel sympathy any point for these characters However flip side chemistry friendship between two characters seems real enough but there something lacking Even rank thoroughly enjoyable film not let trailer fool you into thinking another sciencefiction horror film much more comedy than indeed worth watching though purely for concept itself
