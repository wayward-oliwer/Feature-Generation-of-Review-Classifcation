like films dont provide typical happy ending main reason for liking movie Alice Marano Danes her best friend Darlene Beckinsale are arrested Thailand for narcotics smuggling after tip anonymously phoned Thai authorities film does solid job keeping viewers guessing whether which girls involved Bill Pullman perfect their sleazy lawyer Jacqueline Kim turns terrific performance more kind magnanimous wife Yon who also attorney wish girls had been abused more prison another commenter suggested Ive heard Thai prisons can quite brutal Where film grabs however ending Alice subjects herself sentence years total Darlene can pardoned viewers realize they are both innocent Any film defies expectation ending wins extra points with wellacted drama certainly deserving
