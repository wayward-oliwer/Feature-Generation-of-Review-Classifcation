film resembles many ways Enemy State with Will Smith Gene Hackman have innocent black man pursued government with all modern technology known man Usually when storyline copied like result disaster does not apply here course love everything David Morse does maybe comments are not fair but there were more good things about film then main baddy played Doug Hutchison brilliant story flowed with excellent extras such David Paymer Robert Pastorelli Our hero Alvin Sanders played Jamie Foxx however irritating most part out place cracking bad jokes evoking sympathy from audience not begin with strange thing kinda grows you followers well didnt expect much when rented but surprised with good solid action movie with comedy bits 710
