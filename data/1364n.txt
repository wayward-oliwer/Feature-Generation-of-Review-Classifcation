had such high hopes for film because loved original much seems Disney however trying perfect art crappy straighttoDVD sequels They deserve razzie Several fact thought idea had merit but music absolutely story wasnt much better What happened great music Disney used have their films Mary Poppins Aladdin Beauty Beast Lion Kingeven Hercules Hunchback Notre Dame Theyve made many great movies over years really sad theyve sunk point making sequels arent even good enough put theatres hope movie not indication things come for Walt Disney Corporation
