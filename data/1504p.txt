went into Deathtrap expecting well orchestrated intriguing thriller while something like what film also cant help but think just poor mans Sleuth classic 1972 film obviously inspiration for film not particularly terms plot but certainly case with execution casting Michael Caine central role just confirms film based play Ira Levin who previously wrote Rosemarys Baby Stepford Wives focuses Sidney Bruhl playwright whose best days are behind him After latest play bombs Sidney finds himself low not helped when play named Deathtrap written amateur taught arrives doorstep Deathtrap guaranteed commercial success Sidney soon begins hatching plot own which involves inviting round amateur scribe killing him then passing Deathtrap off own work Despite all clever twists turns Deathtrap falls down one primary element characters film fails provide single likable character very hard care about story when youre not rooting for any players not helped acting Michael Caine puts good entertaining performance you would expect but nobody else does themselves proud Christopher Reeve awkward role while Dyan Cannon somehow manages make only possibly likable character detestable with frankly irritating performance lucky then story good just about good enough save film plot features plenty twists turns some work better than others but theres always enough ensure film stays interesting Director Sidney Lumet deserves some credit too style film another huge plus central location interesting own right cinematography fits film well Overall have admit did enjoy film but could have been much much better
