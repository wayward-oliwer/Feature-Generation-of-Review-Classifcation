you fast forward through horrible singing you will find classic fairy tale underneath Christopher Walken very humorous surprisingly good role trademark style acting works well for sly Puss Boots other actors are well for their parts did not find any acting terribly fake awkward king particular appears real dunce though wonder supposed can not remember original tale special effects are typical eighties but least they are not overly fake like some computer generated fare see today Overall recommend movie for children adults who are child heart
