would have rated series perfect for outstanding consistently high quality story character development had not been for last episode Season final episode 10th season Unending where would certainly appear Asgard have been killedoff very rushed unconvincing very unceremonious fashion left disbelief From extremely rushed end series obvious many story arcs were originally scheduled occur over least one more season guess would they rapidly accelerated these stories position Stargate SG1 franchise for two upcoming directtoDVD moves Unless Asgard return future SG1 movie with very good explanation apparent extinction think fans have been cheated with poor cleanup looseends Poor end otherwise brilliant scifi series
