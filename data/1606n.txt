not familiar with trilogy but came upon film last night Showtime film looked very well done with set design cinematography but screenplay stilted wooden acting fairly bad thought two female leads were serviceable You never really believed anything supporting actors said though There were stereotypes biblethumping Reverend without hint nuance authoritative Captain hotheaded soldier etc sorry say based these deficiencies clocked straight away Canadian without knowing suchthe Telefilm Canada end credits gave away know horrible person Maybe missed something beginning but hostility towards girls never explained Here they are besieged fort werewolves men are wasting time energy brutalizing two young women for reason FOCUS people Theres bit more pressing situation beyond your walls than whether not these girls are lesbiansthats just inference for hostility directed towards them they can aim fire gun you might well make nice with them question their immortal soul can resolved later Also guess relates rest trilogy these girls are supposed protagonists One them murdered Indian guy end saved one their lives guess one just victim her condition who cant necessarily blamed for her actions but other just murderer who doesnt deserve her happy ending
