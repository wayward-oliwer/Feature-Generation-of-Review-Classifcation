really liked ZB1 Really did have problem with extremely lowbudget movies have enjoyed movies with worse production values than ZB3 you can imagine such thing check out wiseguys zombies youre interested Indeed prefer lower budget zombie films because suspicious Hollywood directors not understand what zombies are about But ZB3 just bad retarded dont want bother dignified criticism want minutes back etc Except really only took minutes because partway through put into 14X fast forward Okay heres some criticism pacing TERRIBLE Everyone talked monologues Even when someone just had single line camera work editing insertion bunch Fbombs into every sentence made line FEEL like monologue first excited about minute running time compared ZB1s minutes but there were actually fewer events ZB3 all talking gore effects got stupider Just glop rubbed around peoples tummies Despite epic exposition there really wasnt plot exposition indeed epic wont spoil youre watch Dont watch But then just bunch lame characters walking around bickering for minutes fewer you choose
