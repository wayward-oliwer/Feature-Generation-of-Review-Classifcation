afraid didnt like movie very much Apart from few saving graces nothing write home about Jhorror boomed for last fivesix years but films themselves have more than one account been repetitive carbon copies previous success one them Basically supernatural slasher movie beginning promising with chilling scenes from morgue where dead girl her eyes graphically sewn together but soon after opens them However after quickly downhill for flick kind will start with things like about Gawi plus side visuals are gaudy movie looks great for type For those who like their horror movies gory there are few nicely executed pun intended murder scenes also get few good suspense sequencessetpieces However there are quite few drawbacks also First all major complaint about movie plot skips jumps forwards backwards time with alarming intensity Usually not problem for but here where students look exactly same matter what age they are confused more than one occasion performances are okay guess little hard tell when you dont know language but seem little stiff for horror movie dont think scary enough For while quite bored actually fan giallo movies expecting quite lot from Nightmare but unfortunately quite disappointed
