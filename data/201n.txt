Saw movie early preview cannot stress enough how bad thought film From very beginning audience groaning over Pacinos southern accent Poor looked really really haggard cant decide whether purposely part role drug addicted publicist perhaps just didnt get any sleep before coming set Much worse than Pacinos close however wretched excuse for plot Early film are given indications Pacinos character gay suspect what screenwriter had originally intended Later however are supposed suspend our incredulity believe both Tea Leoni Kim Basinger both whom are sleepwalking through lame roles lust after elderly half dead looking effeminate man with ridiculous accent worst part overall main plot thread which had with some corporate espionage never fully explained never ever care about slightest Because preview will reserve final judgment because possibility reshoots editing but you can bet will not pay cent see theaters
