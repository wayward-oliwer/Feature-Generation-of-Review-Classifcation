Sholay Considered one greatest films always wondered they would ever remake classic time RGV announced movie somewhat excited see always thought maybe will good movie but every week would here RGV change something movie very BGrade movie something had not hoped really tried looking for positives but promised keep Sholay out mind cinematography awesome movie tries own But side action sequences are weak screenplay had potential biggest flaw editing None scenes excite you For example comedy sequences felt very out place forced Ironic because comedy just entertaining original none characters are developed scenes will linger until end ending very disappointing biggest question acting Amitabh Bachchan good Gabbar Singh nothing great seemed they concentrated too much look character only looks menacing but you dont get creeped out Mohanlal barely movie but impresses few scenes Ajay Devgan decent wasnt much performance gave all weak script Prashant Raj very confident potential make far with better movies had most expectations for Sushmita Sen who probably best lot She expressive but still not enough Nisha Kothari surprised She seemed disinterested for most part but her emotional scene after her friends death quite good Seems she needs find director who will help her talent not her cute looks But what disappointed most chemistry Ajay Devgan Prashant Raj didnt look like friends AjayNisha were not strong couple passion found between Sushmita Prashant Amitabh Mohanlal did not hateful passion they needed for songs they pretty much suck Urmilas Mehbooba too overblown pretty much slept through however nicely danced Holi number enjoyable but not memorable Same went for other songs For someone who looked forward movie heavily disappointed had high hopes for RGV because Jungle but seems lost talent during shooting movie But hopefully regains talent for Sarkar Raj But movie best forgotten All positives still not make for boring movie
