just rented Creep not all impressed didnt feel anything film felt sick because gore alone shocking walked out living room several times desperation something would happen with film Havent seen all before didnt like any characters barr guy sewer cage felt bad for him But then again couldnt think why still alive not murdered Creep many questions need answered Someone mentioned references PS2 game Silent Hill can see similarities vaguely Not bad film not good one judge for yourself
