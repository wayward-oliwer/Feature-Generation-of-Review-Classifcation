Priyadarshans HERA PHERI nice situational comedy film however actually lacks story but quite funny but illogical fact they proper story yet somehow manages nice flow though isnt anything great first half funny scenes like one where Akshay John invite Neha for lunch another when Paresh enters first half gets boring slowly but second half funnier though they script jokes are funny though one does wonder how they never hear each persons voices from inside rooms climax confusion treated like stage play but quite funny But film ends abruptly Direction okay Music good Akshay Kumar excels part which now become second skin but film completely overshadows everyone else John stumbles throughout fails comedy Paresh Rawal hilarious Rajpal okay girls are loud times awkward too Nargis Daisy Neetuonly Neetu seen now are good parts but shriek too often Manoj Joshi okay
