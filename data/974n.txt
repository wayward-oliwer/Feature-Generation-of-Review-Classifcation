spouse found movie very schlocky started out good but quickly got unbelievable ridiculous Most acting poor with exception little girl Abbie who really terrific addition dialog predictable lame especially Gideon Angels Also without giving away anything when one characters tragedy she almost appears nonchalant first thought shock but then realized just terrible script love almost all Hallmark movies their heartwarming stories but movie doesnt rise occasion one There are many great ones dont waste your time with horrible movie
