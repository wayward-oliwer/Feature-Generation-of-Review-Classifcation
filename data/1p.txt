You know Robin Williams God bless him constantly shooting himself foot lately with all these dumb comedies done decade with perhaps exception Death Smoochy which bombed when came out but now cult classic dramas made lately have been fantastic especially Insomnia One Hour Photo Night Listener despite mediocre reviews quick DVD release among best work period very chilling story even though doesnt include serial killer anyone physically dangerous for matter concept film based actual case fraud still yet officially confirmed high school read autobiography child named Anthony Godby Johnson who suffered horrific abuse eventually contracted AIDS result moved story until read reports online Johnson may not actually exist When saw movie confused feelings Robin Williams brilliantly portrayed resurfaced mind Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too ultimately sociopathic caretaker Her role far cry from those she had movies like Little Miss Sunshine There were even times she looked into camera where thought she staring right takes good actress play sort role understated yet well reviewed role makes Toni Collette probably one best actresses generation not have even been nominated for Academy Award 2008 incredible there least one woman world who like scary too good dark film highly recommend prepared unsettled though because movie leaves you with strange feeling end
