saw movie with two grown children Although not clever Shrek thought rather good movie theatre surrounded children who were spring break there not sound know children all liked There parents also seemed engaged death apparent death characters brought about appropriate gasps comments Hopefully people realize movie made for kids such successful although liked too Personally liked Scrat
