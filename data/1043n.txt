used LOVE movie kid but seeing again years later actually sucks Academy might have been ahead time back 1980 but almost nothing offer today Movies like Caddyshack Stripes holdup much better today than steaming dogpile great jokes except for oneliners weve all heard million times now recently bought DVD hopes would gem remembered Well WAY off soundtrack had only widelyrecognizable hits not smash compilation others had mentioned frequent voiceovers were terrible only thing interesting predicting what characters lines were before they said them Yep watched movie much back then only reason writing review give two cents why movie should forgotten sorry say
