Aside from great movie METROPOLIS about oldest pure scifi movie While times film bit preachy acting can bit broad great film for two reasons First extremely original both style content Even 21st century there are films can think are anything like Second for time special effects were absolutely incredibleusing matte paintings models huge casts create amazing scenes both postapocalyptic world vast city tomorrow Sure you could sit back knock film because todays standards effects are only soso But you must appreciate state art when film came out 1936 must have really amazed audiences many ways sets look highly reminiscent modern cities featured 1939 WORLDS FAIR think movie also interesting because seems torn question are people really stupid are destined for greatness end result seems little both How true final note saw twice just short time ago video All three times sound print quality stankparticularly sound available DVD hopefully lot cleaner will provide optional captioning sound video kept cutting out really would have appreciated
