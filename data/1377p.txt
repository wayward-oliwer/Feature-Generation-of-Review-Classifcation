Ive seen movie when traveling Brazil found difficult really understand Brazilian culture society because many regional class differences see movie Sao Paulo itself revelation shows something everyday life many Brazilians other side sometimes little bit overdramatized only negative comment have film sometimes too much too much sex too many murders too much cynicism for one film director could film some things bit more subtle would make film more effective Despite liked movie way story unravels itself characters are complex very much like reallife people Not pretty American actors actresses with lot cosmetics but people who could ugly beautiful same time makes film realistic even when story not convincing
