With fault actors they all put great performances overall story not very well executed movie opens with great zinger crazy old guy forces young Aborigine girls car off road But then were forced endure minutes character development with entirely new group characters dont know why until minutes are turns out they are ones who eventually discover girls body story progresses from there While story does pick point really goes nowhere After hours asked myself there point just see characters struggle with accusations racism stupidity how they handled discovery story ultimately unsatisfying felt unfinished While well acted theres not strong enough backbone film warrant recommending
