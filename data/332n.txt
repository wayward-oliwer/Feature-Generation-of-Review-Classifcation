movie stinks dont think have ever seen movie strung shock value plot relatively interesting but dialog super flat acting bland could have been good movie think just relied grotesque visuals can usually handle graphic scenes human taboos but felt like Miike shot for sake shooting Just one poorly executed film There just isnt anything entertained watching film unless you are fascinated exhausting yourself with explicit scenes incest pedophilia necrophilia rape self milking parental sibling abuse fecal dispersement think just sold film many you but meant when said stinks succeeded other films but think youd better off watching someone pooping
