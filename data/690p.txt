Lion King without doubt favorite Disney movie all time figured maybe should give sequels chance did Lion King pretty good had good laughs fun with Timon Pumba Only problem feel sometimes explanations are needed because they can create plot holes just feeling wanting your own explanation Well would highly recommend movie for lion King fans just night with family fun flick with same laughs lovable characters first hopefully Ill get same with third installment Lion King series Sit back just think Hakuna Matata means worries 810
