Richard Willaims animation god hampered directing film producer final product very uneven film with very convoluted story but some amazing moments animation like Emery Hawkins Greedy Joe Raposos repetitive music doesnt help either made wide screen doesnt show all glory lets hope for letterboxed DVD someday Still worth watching for some eye popping animation
