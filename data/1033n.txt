rented movie DVD knew movie wouldnt live what promised back case but once saw Leatherface Gunnar Hansen had rent starts off pretty good with premise snuff films are aired over cable However main character nothing about her make you feel sorry for her whatsoever end movie really leaves you hanging There are way too many unanswered questions There great scene end totally took surprise but overall very sub par movie but guess worth 399 rental fee
