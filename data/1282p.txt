enjoyed film very much Many Korean people will feel familiar with film because many them have tutors when they school Cinematography average movie would have been better angel movement camera more irregular Editing however very neat unusual acting also very good Kim Neul usually played innocent weak girl Korean soapopaeras But time she plays cute tomboy very well Kwon Sang Woo also plays role very believable What like most about film emotion characters are not too exaggerated There are many Korean romance films characters cry river before audience always thought very stale There such crap movie Very funny welldone
