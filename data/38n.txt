basing observations one episode saw last night 92706 dont think Ill watching again acting totally wooden plot completely predictable ending totally unrealistic mean who would believe million dollar judgment for death recovering drug addict with terminal cancer lead actor Victor Garber seemed uncomfortable almost embarrassed role perhaps realized how bad writing fully realize drama offered season pretty poor but they can surely find better writers Maybe they are outsourcing writing India China Ill bet wont seeing one next season
