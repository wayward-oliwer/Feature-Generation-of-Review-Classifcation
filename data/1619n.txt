THHE2 entertaining youll laugh lot cringe probably say sht get your face away from goddamn hole you dumbs things along those lines but dont know really worth seeing very annoyed throughout entirety with horrible military characters who dont seem know first thing about combat there more violence gore higher body count than first one but still debating whether cancels out feeling throughout whole movie about how ridiculous not good ridiculousness like Dead Alive Feast time would have been better spent watching Ajas remake for 5th time for some laughs for some gore but dont hoping come out satisfied
