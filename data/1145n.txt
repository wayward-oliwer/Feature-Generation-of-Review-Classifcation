love Jane Austens stories Ive only read two them but after having seen adaption reaching for Persuasion from bookcase just make sense out story also because refusing believe Jane Austen could have written such nonsense For thought you base film Jane Austen novel you cant really wrong will turn out great pretty much default wrong First all where are characters you sympathise with like You have have least one likable character get audience invest their emotions them did not deliver Sure wanted Anne Wentworth get together but only because what you know purpose story them getting together Instead had resist urges throw teacup continue watching end Anne utterly annoying throughout end really have idea why Wentworth smitten her there seemed nothing there for him attracted She meek bland dull socially inadequate came across like sheep following everyone elses instructions rather than having mind her own can still work for lead character you well wasnt done well other characters were just displaying various degrees narcissism which Mary worst with fullblown narcissistic personality disorder Where Bennet had similar flaws she still endearing whereas Mary more freakshow More loathsome than funny Wentworth very handsome seemed like decent kind guy For most part story just wondering what kind person why love with Anne surely kind guy who would want person who little bit more alive Actingwise not too much say reacted more characters portrayed rather than how goodbad people acting were Anthony Head excellent but soon saw expected less Also found story very confusing wasnt until end movie where seemed Elizabeth not Annes stepmother but fact sister still not 100 whole AnneWentworth back story also bit fuzzy They had been together but then broke theyre both bitter about How come wondering for quite some time explanation seemed she dumped him because she persuaded someone But said kind way almost missed somehow unimportant How can unimportant when very core story There also lot namedropping but real feel for who characters were Louisa person for instance who she friend Family What wasnt made very clear who different characters are their relationship with one another Lady Russell there lot but why Croft Wentworth were brother sister which felt very unrealistic Croft looked old enough mother final kiss bit strange them kissing street but didnt really think about because too busy yelling GET WITH ALREADY because Annes lips trembled trembled trembled for what felt like ages before they actually met Wentworths Have SOME hesitation there but only for couple seconds not half minute Then theres issue camera work regular movie watcher you dont pay attention angles such unless you decide look out for didnt decide here but still noticed them means filmmakers are not good job lot conversations were with extreme facial closeups something should only used when theres really important point made adaption overused therefore lacked meaning handheld feeling occasion also didnt really work period drama camera work running scene end also felt too contemporary Not mention running itself only Austen adaption caught ITVs Austen season Makes wonder worth watching Northanger Abbey Mansfield Park should just read books leave sad say Jane Austen adaption did not enjoy Maybe Ill watch 1995 version instead BBC are renowned for having done beautiful Austen adaptations before after all
