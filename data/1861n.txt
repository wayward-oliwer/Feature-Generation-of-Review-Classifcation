cant believe NONE official reviews for movie warn people contains two quite upsetting sexual assault scenes though our culture accepts kind behavior simply sexual but not violent biggest problem with movie doesnt seem condemn these assaults woman who repeatedly assaulted pressured never holds men accountable for their actions neither does anyone else One man stopped from completing assault when someone throws dagger him but reprimanded only with you cannot force woman love you rather than you should never force woman sexually you jerk From womans point view movie let down sort throws bone women letting them both skilled fighters leaders but movie much more defined romance which characterized notion human sexuality must involve imbalance power with men dominating woman they love amazing martial arts fighter doesnt use any her fighting skills try fend off her attackers She never even makes them apologize rather SHE seems apologetic Overall depressing upsetting movie with some great cinematography some cool fight scenes but not good Hero long shot
