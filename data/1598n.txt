movie pretty bad Scifi usually favorite channel watch all original movies play really dont know movie can called original Starting zootheme park remote island sounds pretty familiar What yeah Jurassic Park But Sabertooth tigers instead movie starts out with few stereotypical college kids island some kind treasure hunt One them ends dieing rather gruesome death with some worst special effects Ive seen blood looked lot like ketchup Also beginning there scientist who wants make many saber tooth tigers possible for people enjoy them have already escaped are around eating tourists people invited island see tigers first hand Again sound like Jurassic Park Probably coolest thing 1000lb saber tooth who crawled around front legs killing mad scientist with tooth statue sorts somehow shrinks goes through guys neck Funniest death Ive seen acting extremely cheesy special effects are horrible tigers could almost pass for clay models even some sounds were off For instance when one college students trying escape uses break down door goes into door about seconds later you hear sound movie pretty bad cheesy deaths were quite funny though
