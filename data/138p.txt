would like comment series great effort story line although requiring few improvements pretty well especially season Season however became more freak show lost original charm Season one story line more interesting light side life Jam pony while focused serious plot with manticore chasing down Xseries looking forward new seasons fact still hope FOX guys production crew realize lot ppl still wait for make comeback Even after cancelled can make big worked properly think name like James Cameron should take challenge
