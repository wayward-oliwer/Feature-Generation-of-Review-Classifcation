actually paid see movie theater would get 1rating but fight scenes between robots are okay theres surprise realize some movies have larger budgets than others dont have problem with Unfortunately science fiction movies probably suffer most small budget for obvious reasons But one way movie fails just about every piece each set looked cheesy cheap mean couldnt they even make look good other major reason movie horrible acting watched movie now knew what expect might just enjoy for cheesefactor but time expecting good movie had clue how horrible would actually end Thankfully experience over only minutes
