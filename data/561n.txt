mention Ann Rivers Siddons adapted material for House Next Door from her 1970s novel same title someone else did Lifetimelike movie directed Canadian director Jeff Woolnough Having read book long time ago decided take chance when film showed cable version what clearly movie made for television You know when critical moments precede commercials which course one cant find version watched films star Lara Flynn Boyle who sports new look threw viewer curve because cosmetic transformation actress gone through From new eyebrows other parts her body Boyle hardly recognizable Col Kennedy character center mystery not one actress better moments front camera goes for rest mainly Canadian actors deserved better film feeling cross between Desperate Houswives with Stepford Wives other better known features combined with mild dose creepiness best thing about movie house which serves setting
