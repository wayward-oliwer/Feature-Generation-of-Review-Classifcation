still wonder why watched movie Admittedly before viewed film knew practicly nothing about beatles didnt even know all their names All knew they had ton fans they had some albums some people claim greatest ever they broke John married Yoko Ono John murdered Also VH1 isnt even favorite music station MTV Still for some reason another decided watch not expecting much Surprisingly enjoyed very much dialogue written handled very well with occasion slight accent mess very important because John Paul talking pretty much whole film allthough they are taken outside explore more possibilities keep you watching Jared Harris Adien Quinn give good performacesoverall ending also very smart enjoyed how movie gets you excited about SNL performace then slaps you over head makes you realize would better they just let end good note favorite moment probably touching rooftop scene Overall recommend film almost everyone very good way settling your curiosity what could have happened years after break Paul just showed Johns doorstep Which probably main reason viewing film settling curiosity who beatles really were what could have happened them after breakup
