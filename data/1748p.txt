JÃ¶rg Buttgereit goes bit too far with movies themes times even for taste but movies are always something special hard classify They are artistically made with also often deeper meaning themes movie perfect example work also really hard label movie not really movie with story sense having beginning middle end also doesnt have main character but instead focuses different suicides killings different days All different stories are told with lots class though some them are course more interesting realistic than others They are not necessarily connected but yet together they still tell story movie doesnt feel disjointed all All different stories have different feel Buttgereit tells story without hardly using any words also typical for style but instead lets images obvious sensible emotions characters tell entire story helps make movie effective one watch Again production values all arent too high might something might scare off some people however helps for particular movie set right tone atmosphere for entire movie dark disturbing depressing themes Buttgereit movie enjoyed watching 710
