agree with last reviewer movie had terrible acting there lot gore some nudity But overshadowed slowmoving meaningless plot dumb ending Where supposed filmed anyway Canadian Chinatown Hong Kong Hostel much better movie would recommend seeing instead technical annoyance had with DVD you shut off Spanish subtitles they return after few scenes then you have back main menu turn them off again Also dont waste your time deleted scenes because theres audio just looks like tourist footage
