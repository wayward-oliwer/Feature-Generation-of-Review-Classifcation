what kind sht Power rangers Freddy watchable good first film beginning but from part where protagonists get super powers theirs dreams started become childish sht should have been rated PG13 rather than expected see some very mature stuff but only for film rest are for little kids Plus focused too much Christianity know Freddys demon but there are many religions have different ways fight demons Why does always have Christianity total Orientalism filled with white menwesterners superiority Dont watch show little kids who loves power rangers
