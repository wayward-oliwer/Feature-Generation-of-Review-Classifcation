good idea badly implemented While could summarize SciFi channels movies really applies here love movies where good back story slowly revealed like action movies like all main actors could have been great However despite some good acting movie fails due Bill Platts bad writing directing Another review made good point needing know where youre you can get there movie doesnt put together such haphazard way you know words second draft are not Bill Platts vocabulary There one scene entirely unnecessary could removed without anyone noticing scene even begins ends with them driving car you could cut from one car scene other never have missed pointless scene middle movie also had strange habit under explaining some details while over explaining others some point where you can guess entire plot front also had habit aborting fight early probably just because they couldnt afford There are also few laughably bad scenes where plot revealed computer final battle involving conveniently placed toxic adhesive seriously what you are fan Shiri Appleby watch movie because shes She does manage break out her Roswell persona few times make for good tough chick but not always John Lancie plays same character plays everything ever done since playing back STTNG nothing new all gave movie 410 rating
