JIST See something else film highly rated Gene Siskel but after watching cant figure out why film definitely original different even interesting dialogue times some cool moments creepy noir feel But just isnt entertaining also doesnt make whole lot sense plot but especially character motivations dont know anyone behaves like these characters difficult movie take suggest you dont accept challenge
