When you look back another bad Nightmare sequel like Freddys Revenge you have least give some credit for trying something new although Dream Child more enjoyable offers absolutely nothing new series theres creative deaths usual like kid becoming part comic book facing Super Freddy but even scenes like arent used their full potential parts without Freddy are just boring marked official death scariness series Freddy seems comedic relief nowbut what Rating 410
