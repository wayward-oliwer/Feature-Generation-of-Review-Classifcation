had background knowledge movie before bought but sounded cool Ive been wanting see really kickbutt Viking movie for awhile now alas film not what looking for had hoped for best but instead delivered boring Nordic soapopera seemed drag too long despite minute running time films premise intriguing enough about Viking warlord who defies God Odin enraged curses warlords son named Barek death rebirth Berserker Barek guy then forced live enraged insane violent lifetime after lifetime movie filmed competently enough with some rich cinematography quasigood performances actors but again found myself bored questioning when dribble would end filmmakers had chance make something rather entertaining semiunique but they dropped ball Perhaps couldve been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown such gratuitous nudity lots gore mean are talking about Berserkers here arent Vikings were supposed BAD enough what with all raping pillaging arent Berserkers supposed even more extreme All all unless youre fan Young Restless etc are yourself fact insane Berserker who likes self torture probably steer clear drab piece celluloid
