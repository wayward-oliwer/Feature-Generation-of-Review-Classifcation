must admit big fan South Park expecting Basketball funny but nowhere near good turned out think what happens when you mix David Zucker Matt Stone Trey Parker together movie much replay value point bothers take itself seriously slap stick style humor mixed with Stone Parker just works flawlessly kind humor present Basketball not popular upon time release had come out today would hit Dont bother trying critical just leave your brain door expect endless laughs come Recommended anyone with good sense humor
