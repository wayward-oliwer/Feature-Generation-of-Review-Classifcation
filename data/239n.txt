Ive seen lot crap day but goodness Hot Rod takes cake saw free screening other night can only hope they show funny version paying customers big laughs were sparse plot uninteresting characters were one dimensional best One highlight hilarious dancing scene with Adam Samberg priceless only scene truly had hearty laugh Other than can only recollect randomness dead air SNL Samberg fans may disappointed know expecting more from But short definitely would not recommend attending free screening paying watch film
