big fan Cormans horror movies expected from western bit more than got Well entertained all right had almost many laughs watching Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles See spectacle mobile tire tracks prairie old west You can kill time counting them there happens otherwise boring scene horses seem have gears them too considered fastforward chases See also swinging bar room queens traditional wild west saloon number reminds certain fashionable dance from 1920s here decades before style invented Hope saloon around them wont crumple middle all mayhem main actors decent job Ireland Garland Hayes are all truly fine special praise for them for best they could with material seems mostly having been lifted from Johnny Guitar but doesnt quite impress same way But there really nothing wrong with laughable western like Just like really bad old horror movie might fail one way but succeeds give joy anyway one reasons Cormans work appeals why dare recommend you experience movie you get chance
