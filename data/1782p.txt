saw film store cheap section actually vividly remembered seeing commercials trailer for years ago thought What hey bought basically because plot sounded interesting Claire Danes always been someone talent eyes also before became huge Kate Beckinsale fan about two girls who sneak off vacation Bangkok get busted for narcotics which they are innocent then are sent Thailand prison film follows what will happen them times questions their innocence Both Claire Danes Kate Beckinsale give great performances plot film wraps itself unconventionally raises some nice moral discussion questions think solid good film but there could have been some improvements could have been longerit wouldve helped solidify these characters more insight into politics Thailands justice system wouldve helped Nevertheless other than good film with some great performances For all you popculture junkies lookout for twominute role Paul Walker didnt even notice him first time saw film
