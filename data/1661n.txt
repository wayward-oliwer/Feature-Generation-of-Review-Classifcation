someone who both read novel seen film have different take why film such flop First any comparisons between novel film are purely superficial They are two different animals novel probably intended satire but arrives cross between tragedy polemic instead Any comedic elements such those which later formed stylistic basis film version are merely incidental authors uniformly cynical thrust lest omnipresent white suit author fool you into thinking another Mark Twain think again more apt literary precedent would spectre Ambrose Bierce top hat tails Tom Wolfe equal parts clown hack more celebrity than author always looking for new grist for selfabsorbed mill therefore wonder excellent production skills direction lavished making film were doomed from start Unlike true satire which translates very well into film polemics are grounded not universally accessible observations some form other human behavior but singleminded attack specific people whether real fictional straw men who have somehow earned wrath writer Any effort create successful filmed story narrative from such beginning must have clean start free writers influence interference Having said too find fault with casting not merely incompetents like Bruce Willis Melanie Griffith fail measure but real talents like Tom Hanks Murray Abraham Morgan Freeman are either totally wasted given roles are mere caricatures There enough topical material here for truly great film satire but fails come even close
