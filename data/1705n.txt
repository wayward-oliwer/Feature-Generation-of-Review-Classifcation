absolute worst performance from Robert Duval who sounds just like William Buckley throughout entire film hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest not sure deliberate scene stealing inadvertent but only thing can recall from truly forgettable film picture should shown every amateur acting class example what not Thank God Duvall went bigger better things stopped trying effect cultured accent good character actor but about Klaus much better performance muted noteworthy
