got Mirror Mirror mainly because Yvonne Carlo thought she great American Gothic but sadly she didnt have very big role film starts off pace moves along nicelybut end starts getting bit tedious dull not say boring film but just very average nothing spectacular didnt like posession side there were decent gore scenes Plus main story very confusing ending doesnt make much sense all did however like story surrounding Gothic girl how she got revenge her tormentors wouldnt particularly recommend Mirror Mirror horror fans nothing wet yourself over
