title film nearly put off watching Not Manchester United fan mere mention Beckham bit off putting however put prejudices behind glad did wasnt expecting much film but pleasantly surprised film sped along with never looking watch enjoyed every second film you liked East East then youll love film storyline nothing new classic storylines are contained within film but all done very funnily with breath fresh air film moves very fast keeps audiance entertained occaisional funny moments are good chuckle not some poor attempt humour best all good british comedy
