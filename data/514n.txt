have say worst film priyadarshanreleasing alongside much better kyonki which also directorial venture contains specific storyline just focuses body showing debuting actresses some silly comedy sequences think priyadarshan becoming too much repetitive comedy flicks just like govinda David dhavan had done past after giving some good entertainers they also went loose their audiencesSo will good for him concentrate more script try some variations directionGive more herapheris malamal weeklys rather than giving duds like garam masala
