one should ever try adapt Tom Robbins book for screen While movie fine performances are good dialogue which works well reading crap when spoken put another way one would likely suggest hearing someone elses name like seeing written radium pearl Overall movie feels like badlyadapted Cliffs Notes book most parts have been hacked down fifth their size book terms backstory current story ending wildly unpleasantly different from book Most plots from book have gotten lost including one makes everything make sense end theres more than one reference makes sense book makes viewer say Huh Not worthy effort unfortunately script should have been read compared book burned all actors sent off something far better admire Van Sant tremendously but not even someone calibre could have made decent movie such complex book without making miniseries
