Ive come realise from watching Euro horror especially films made cult luminary Jess Franco you cant expect plot makes much sense However Franco gone overboard with film despite surreal atmosphere films reputation one directors best Succubus unfortunately truly film Ive got admit saw American cut version which runs about minutes but unless just logic cut sure longer European version just boring plot something with woman marauding around practicing talking rubbish all really boring Theres gore sex dull most runtime taken boring dialogue despite fact short film had difficulty making all way end have say locations look good Franco done good job using surreal atmosphere but positive elements end there Jess Franco definitely talented director made some classic trash films but looks like one made for money overall recommend skipping seeing some directors more interesting works
