Though like Doc Smiths books David Kyles books Lensman anime which loosly based books quite fun somewhat innovative fair Though story may seem familiar SciFiFantasy buffs such some kid isolated planet inherits mystical powers avenges death family quite entertaining one nonetheless Plus Lensman first Animated motion picture use hand drawn animation all once Sure may look bit outdated now but still innovation were not for Lensman none would have ever happened personally think Computer Graphics look better animation live action Too bad they only released DVDVCD few countries worls mostly formats are quite foreign different just wish they release Lensman movie series DVDVCD EVERY part world not just certain parts Worsel rules just think amazing neat looking well
