admit vampire addict have seen many vampire movies have lost count one definitely top ten very impressed original John Carpenters Vampires when descovered there sequel went straight out bought movie does not obey quite same rules first not quite dark but close enough felt built nicely original Jon Bon Jovi very good Derek Bliss performance likeable yet hard enough for viewer believe might actually able survive world which lives One favourite parts just after meets Zoey wanders into bathroom diner check see she more than she seems comments are beautifully irreverant yet emminently practical which contrast well with rest scene unfolds other cast members were also well chosen they knitted nicely produce entertaining original film not simply rehash first movie grown similar way way Fright Night grew out Fright Night There are different elements which make fresh movie with similar theme you like vampire movies would recommend one you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else
