very surprised see such high rating for film few reviews there are positive saw movie pretty dissapointed didnt find very enjoyable all slow lacks entertainment value Even murder scenes are lackluster with real closeup shots generic stabbings dont look good all supposed great twist ending really not much did see coming then ending just seemed cliche movie may not get much mention but little does get overrated would not recommend movie
