story idea behind LOST MISSILE isnt bad all but unfortunately story does get bit dull towards middle overuse stock footage well poor special effects sink film subpar level film begins with missile heading towards Earth panic because about strike Earth Soviets manage deflect object isnt necessarily good however seemingly unmanned craft vapor trail destroys everything path ship now low orbit over planet other words with each pass makes swath death followsone could potentially kill all good scientists led very young hardly recognizable Robert Loggia formulate plan save usand especially save New York immediate flight path Unfortunately they arent able save Ottawa Ive never been there cant say whether not big loss but thanks good old American knowhow they are able eventually destroy harbinger destruction you can see story idea isnt bad rather original But many old clips fighter planes guys manning radar scopes gets bit old seemed like padding Overall decent but hardly inspired film extreme fans genre may likeall others see your own risk
