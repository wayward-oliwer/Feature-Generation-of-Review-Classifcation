While recently gave OPERATION PETTICOAT positive review really didnt like film even though had many similarities Both were made just few years apart both starred Cary Grant both were WWII comedies However overall tone style films were quite different KISS HER FOR overall just seemed like cheaper filmwith poor writing little energy some VERY broad performanceseven when compared OPERATION PETTICOAT think least much blame for lies casting Jayne Mansfield combination her ample talents limited acting ability really made Abudget film look like came from 3rd rate studio Plus there wasnt much chemistry energy pairing her with Cary Grantan actor generally loved for grace class sort like pairing Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main
