Wow forgot how great movie until stumbled upon while looking through garage kind strange combination bio Michael Jackson collection musical vignettes story about super hero fighting save some little kids vignettes are good especially Speed Demon but best part movie super hero segment which Michael Jackson turns into car robot finally spaceship just weird sounds Joe Pesci hilarious enough cool imagery great music entertain throughout real gem however incredible Smooth Criminal video which makes movie worth owning for part alone
