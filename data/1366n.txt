love Anthony Hopkins actor very interested see how would writerdirector could not have been more disappointed move movie disjointed cinematography over done point wanted pull plug out wall actors were very good but such waste talent Not all actors are cut out writers directors clearly Hopkins falls into category all movies have ever seen years absolutely worst movie ever Please all favor Hopkins stick acting which you are excellent leave writing directing those who are talented those areas could give movie rating less than one certainly would
