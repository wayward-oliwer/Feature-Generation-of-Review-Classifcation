rarely write negative review for site but time felt complied Night Listener without doubt one dullest films have ever seen There nothing happening film what ever didnt care for any characters didnt buy whole mystery type plot didnt care how endednothing There comedy action thrills suspense nothing highlights include spoilers theres nothing spoil man climbing through window dog barking outside hotel room car over some rough ground truck beeping horn really enjoyed One Hour Photo hoped for similar eerie role from Williams but alas sorely let down Whats more disappointing sure there good film there somewhere idea interesting should have felt sympathy for characters but just didnt work for might even have given 110 but score reserved for remake Producers
