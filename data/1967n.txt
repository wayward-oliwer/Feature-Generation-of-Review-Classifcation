had several problems with movie screenplay specifically Kim Basingers voice over Movies are not books they should show action rather than have voice over tell whats happening Occasionally find movie with voice over works but here seemed more lazy way writing script fact sounded she practically reading excerpts from novel her voice over felt emotion relationship between Jessie Brother Thomas also felt Alex Carters acting pretty bad significant failure for defining Jessies Thomas characters with connection between them seemed she just wanted stud for him matter sexdeprived had been properly done relationship between them would have given much more context story With book understood Jessies midlife crisis movie seemed more like just plain boredom plus side didnt think movie bad for turn off though thought did occur
