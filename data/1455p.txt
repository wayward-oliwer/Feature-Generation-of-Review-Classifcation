havent seen BSG tried watch once middle show but couldnt get into However saw Caprica Rebirth yesterday felt little lost decided watch Pilot today must say pleasantly surprised think promising show only side effect had now want watch BSG well But what really liked didnt have hardcore BSG fan understand whats Caprica From what have read net they were trying reach female population since BSG reached way more men least case worked However suggest you are trying watch show from beginning starting with Pilot
