found movie great idea didnt deliver seems they found way build suspense but couldnt stage their payoffs very well one case police are clock find hideout kidnappers They painstakingly from dentist dentist match dental record same time kidnapped man Mason escapes through elevator shaft After all build police arrive same time gets free which very anticlimatic say least There are also large narration scenes take inside thinking terrorized husband wife which detracts from suspense rather than adds are fully aware their tension voiceover insult robs viewer any chance personal experience with fear Hitchcock proved time again far more effective greatest disappointment sit through whole movie get quick rather bland ending mean justends snore
