seems general gist these comments film some stunning animation watched bluray but really falls short any real depth Firstly characters are all pretty dull got hint kind Laputa situation between Agito Toola main antagonist Shunack However maybe mind wanderd wishful thinking Laputa favourite animé original Engilsh dub characters are not really lovable either mentioned another post they fall love exceptionally quickly leaving poor old Minka jealous rejected she loves Agito who seems oblivious However she promptly seems forgive Toola end with explanation for change heart other than makes ending little bit more happy There also serious lack explanation Like who are druids really Are they people who are weird womengirls who seem hang out with them run forest There nothing explaining why they are there how they can give regular humans superpowers plants coming from moon still does not fill blanks about almost like weird version Day Triffids who does call Toola why bother with wont explained really wanted like film but found plot where near deep film like Ghost Shell having any real character like those Miyazaki not resent watching but sort wish hadnt bought advice Give you have couple hours spare but borrow buy cheap Perhaps your new animé films dont have much you will enjoy certainly visually pleasing
