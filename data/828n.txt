Let start stating usually like Renny Harlins directing style for most part cinematographer should commended for some shots Unlike Harlins Elm Street Die Hard which really liked there something missing from movie friends script dialogue movies like always pretty but one takes gold medal for stupidity There are many lines movie dont even want have remember any them Not just but execution lines pathetic seems more suited toward bad porn movie than action adventure almost like Harlin thought they slowed down words said they could improve script Wrong again sad part there some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue Stallone never been favorite mine but when acting circles around Lithgow Turner worst bunch Rooker there something wrong with picture Lithgow played one best villains Ricochet yet comes across someone who cant act save life here How possible Ive always been huge fan gets schooled acting Stallone who himself still phonedin performance Turners part small pointless but she still manages appear lost screen Michael Rooker CAN act know because have witnessed Days Thunder but seems like READING lines from cue cards come When Rooker Lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking just wanted movie end right there have them both amazingly find their acting ability Unfortunately neither those things occurred Which brings back Harlin who can only one really blame for mess other than screenwriters fault never drawn into movie all because should have made people actually act script not very good but still actors performances are what destroys movie lie with director dont care how much paid for special effects which for most part are good you still cant just sacrifice movie with terrible acting Plus pacing movie seems off opening sequence good plane scene very well done but how are you supposed care about outcome heist all mean understand they were trying create tension with all bells whistles plane scene but really didnt care they got money not scene bad guys would have won early maybe wouldnt have had witness one worst movies ever
