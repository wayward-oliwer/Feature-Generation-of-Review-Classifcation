Belmondo tough cop goes after bigtime drug dealer played Henry Silva normally great villain see Sharkys Machine but here clearly dubbed because lacks usual charisma goes scuzziest places Paris Marseilles asks for some names beats some people gets names goes more scuzzy places asks for more names beats more people etc whole movie punch after punch after punch seems people who made had other ambition than create French equivalent Dirty Harry Belmondo who here does perform some good stunts beginning apart from those Marginal violent episodic trite shallow forgettable cop movie
