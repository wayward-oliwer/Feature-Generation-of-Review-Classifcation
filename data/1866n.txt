Welloverall movie pretty much worthless basically horror movie ended more comedy just rented movie last night when friends went blockbuster looking for scary movie definitely wasnt what were looking for but satisfied for humor actors movie especially Brandon are fake funny especially Tracy girl whenever shes boarded room telling clown away They show almost emotion just obvious theyre acting also when clown looking through black box paper thing grabs Mark doesnt even look like scared even though clown like grabbed him started attacking him seriously would you just JOGGING you were chased down sprinting for life Even though anyone could probably outrun clown because like 300 Not mention effects arent great like whenever clown chops off Susans head forest then whenever throws her head into boarded room with Denise Tracy whenever Denise throws head back over Also like previous guys comment beginning makes absolutely sense dont even see why even included movie what movie made 2003 music made sound like made like 1980s cameraing doesnt even really look professional Half time seems like camera cant even stay steady when suppose Overall have say enjoyed movie wouldnt recommend though youre trying find something scare you but youre looking for something maybe make fun get laugh out recommend for sure
