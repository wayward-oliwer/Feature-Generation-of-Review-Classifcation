How hard write watchable film with Vince Vaughn Paul Giamatti Kevin Spacey Apparently VERY difficult for writers here still have idea how Santa younger looks years older than Vince who plays BIG brother must have missed part story but reality really didnt matter Many scenes seemed out place contrived kind funny notion scenes are drug out WAY too far where any sense comedy lost directorproducer tried tear jerker end which would have been suitable ANYTHING leading point had been worth following Ugh major disappointment can see how some people might enjoy since many people will take any garbage theyre fed but would strongly encourage waiting for DVD one NOT worth 23978 takes get your family movies these days
