saw movie westbound American Airlines flight bad actually made flight seem longer plot had potential who wouldnt love movie about woman who accidentally kills every Elvis impersonator she meets but got screwed million different times really poor writing Towards end embarrassingly bad scene where gang Elvis impersonators roof casino reshipping sky thinking return then group stars moves together form Elvis constellation which promptly shoots bolt lightning impersonators sending them crashing through roof BadREALLY bad Which theme for whole movie avoid one all costs
