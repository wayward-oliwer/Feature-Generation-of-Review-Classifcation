cute movie first then then got too sappy featured mediocre songs best There too much King James English spoken with not only annoying todays world but not always easy interpret Can you imagine young people today trying listen film Forget Bing Crosby some good lines here likable Hank Martin Rhonda Fleming Alisande Carteloise too addition her good looks beautiful long red hair nice movie with feelgood ending cant knock Maybe worthy rental for historical sake youre big Crosby fan but overall not much
