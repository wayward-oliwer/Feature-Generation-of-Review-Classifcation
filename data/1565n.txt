But does have some good action plot somewhat interesting Nevsky acts like body builder isnt all attractive fact IMO UGLY acting skills lack everything Sascha played very well Joanna Pacula but she needed more lines than she given her character needed developed There are way too many men story there zero romance too much action way too dumb ending very violent did however love scenery movie takes you all over world bonus also liked how had some stuff about mafia not too much too little but enough got attention actors needed more handsomeThe biggest problem had Nevsky just too normal not sexy enough think for most guys Sascha will hot enough but for ladies are fans action Nevsky just doesnt cut Overall movie fine didnt love nor did hate just found another normal action flick
