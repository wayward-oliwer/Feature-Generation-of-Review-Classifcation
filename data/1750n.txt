mildly interesting late gore fest featuring some nasty slugs with taste for human blood you can get past ridiculousness whole thing you might actually get some minor enjoyment out acting plot simply there hold movie together between gory slug attacks but movie isnt complete waste time special effects are actually quite good gore well done reminded remake Blob probably because sliminess all All all you could certainly worse with hour half your time but wouldnt suggest seeing movie unless youve got strong stomach are into sort thing
