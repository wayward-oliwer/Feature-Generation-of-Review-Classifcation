first saw trailer for Frailty Yahoo Movies way back day after hearing Stephen King praise high heaven Not really fan either star still wanted see because huge thriller fan not disappointed acting superb especially from two young boys Usually loathe child actors but Young Adam Young Fenton were excellent Bill Paxton really did good job directing too beautifully shot One must also note plot twists three twists end hit hard fast didnt see them coming final twist film coupled with gravity what had just been revealed gives chills day even though Ive rewatched film many times true gem
