movie few things for right off bat Having Dani Filth lead actor automatically make some people like movie Admittedly love Cradle Filth listened soundtrack movie long before watched Dani Filth very recognizable character makes for great lead independent filming style movie great for creepy factor There are some GORGEOUS actresses movie For low budget special effects werent bad either ways people died were very creative nightmarish Now cons There VERY little talking throughout whole movie thus making for very little far character development hard fear for lives limp static characters When there little talking bomb abundant popping random places understand people swear but seems like preteen boy scripted thought himself cool for including all language storyline what could make out pretty good although many parts are left dangling lack conversation leaves one often wondering whats happening end Cradle Fear like porno for people who love sex violence but like porno trying pull storyline just doesnt work too well Rent though youre morbid person looking sate your blood flesh appetite
