figured any horror film with Orson Welles would weird Necromancy sure but little too weird for own good film does indeed have creepy feel deals with coven satanistswitches small town young womans attempt escape them director though seems deliberately trying confuse audience using flashbacks dream sequences finale there are too many unanswered questions Whats worse story confusing pretty hard root for any characters seems odd Welles would agree headline film especially since doesnt have much Maybe someday they will put out tape outtakes bloopers from movie Now would really fun
