been long time since last saw movie bad acting very average story horribly boring loss for words execution completely unoriginal much comedy Clint Eastwoods pregnant Schwarzenegger One first scenes one with television show where hell are you got right cast lets face forgotten actors they were hoping for career relaunch then think might never happen with their script had potential but neither actors nor director whos actor clearly should stick actor pulled off Fred Durst only one who seemed better than any rest sorry but you ever consider watching highly recommend you turn something less traumatic because not only total loss time but also weak example what bad cinema looks like
