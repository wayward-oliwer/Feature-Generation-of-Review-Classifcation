have say loved Vanishing Point Ive seen original pretty good remake Even though didnt follow original storyline why gave out still pretty good probably better storyline for car well comment end about Challenger 185 mph into bulldozers pretty improbable you look speedometer needle wobbling 145150 but even though didnt see one engine one beginning scenes where they show engine original storyline had supercharged Hemi possible For those you who say aerodynamics wouldnt allow normally aspirated Chrysler 300C today can 168 mph you look thing highway with like pushing brick wall through wind mph Plus wind tunnel test you put air dam Challenger would probably more aerodynamic
