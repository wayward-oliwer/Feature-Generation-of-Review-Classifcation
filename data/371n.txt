film absolutely but nevertheless can hilarious times although humor entirely unintentional plot beyond ridiculous dont even think yearold would convinced ludicrous idiocy filmmakers tried slap together into story However positive side some horrifically inane plot twists provide great deal humor For example Wow Lady Hogbottom giant missile hidden her back yard gets worse even funnier but Ill spare you acting generally laughable Most kids roles are sort cute but not very believable other hand Annie pretty allaround adults dont take their roles seriously all but largely good thing theyd tried believable film wouldve been even worse Which difficult imagine Once you get past overall crappiness movie there are actually few standout moments almostnotcrappiness scene where Lady Hogbottoms son runs away with maid surprisingly hilarious though annoying letdown when they get caught police butler character while very minor ray sunlight almost but never quite pierces through gloom Watching movie actually caused physical pain Nevertheless there were few redeeming parts made almost watchable without beginning hemorrhage internally Judged good parts alone movie would about unfortunately rest movie hardly deserves Thus give pretty generous say
