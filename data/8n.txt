had never thought standard Yashraj films would ever degrade such extent film nonsense storyline which catches interest Saif over acted Kareena improved her figure but not good actress anyway Akshay good Anil also good May say role wasnt good Great deal cheapness filled Wondered supposed comedy part movie Just because last few movies were flops does mean Yashraj films should make kind rubbish history many good films Overall totally disappointed with movie
