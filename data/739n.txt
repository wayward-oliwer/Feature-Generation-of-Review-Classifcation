Now had best intentions when watching one like some Tony Scotts work also friend mine told great movie even though heard otherwise from other people But simply hopeless humble opinion Tony Scott trying too hard all just too much Allow elaborate Miss Knightley overacting not good way people who did perform well were Mickey Rourke Edgar Ramirez Christopher Walken but their screen time just wasnt able save movie There were few scenes jumped out their originality yet somehow felt like they were written someone other than main writer certain tune used around times which really started bug after second time firm believer not using same tune more than once Also editing really went out one cutting rate rather high repetitive echoing some Keiras lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing for second third fourth time Basically opinion you want see actionflick highpaced somewhat funny you dont care about everything mentioned above you might like side note not Keira Knightley fan
