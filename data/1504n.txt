Pallbearer disappointment times extremely boring with love story just doesnt work partly with casting Gwyneth Paltrow Julie Gwyneth Paltrow walks through entire film with confused look her face hard tell what David Schwimmer even sees her However Pallbearer times funny particularly church scene group scenes with friends are laugh but basically Watch Pallbearer for those scenes only fast forward rest Trust you arent missing much
