Upon concluding viewing Trance Eternal whatever producers are calling film wondered myself Out all bad movies could have seen couldnt have least seen one entertaining Even film not well made terms acting directing writing what have you can least fun therefore worthwhile But not only film bad artistic value incredibly boring For plot such thinness moves slowly with little dramatic tension very least lowbrow attempt entertainment deaths characters could have been cool andor gory but creators dreck failed department well What does movie have for Pretty much nothing unless you get entertainment out watching Christopher Walken who capable brilliant put little effort into acting falls into selfparody mode WHY did decide film anyway give film 310 because God help there actually have been worse movies made before
