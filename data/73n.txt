film had much promise very excited about film end laughable best painful worst acting styles ran gamut from really really flat angels wife daughter overanimated Caspers character felt dialogue just attempt transfer information audience instead real people trying talk each other Pay special attention scene regarding bug pretty much insult audiences ability figure things out defense scene though got biggest laugh whole movie had read they spent alot money traveling various overseas locations Too bad they didnt make use didnt feel like transported exotic locations Anybody could insert stock footage Coliseum Rome However end positive note thought sets were pretty good really liked graphics were displayed decoding computers opinionand all SCHMALTZ factor would have been much much lower ACTION factor would have been greatly increased film would have been good
