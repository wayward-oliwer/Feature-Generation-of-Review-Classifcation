had been looking forward seeing film for long time after seeing Return Paradise which found gritty disappointed most realistic thing about unpredictable ending which think partly stolen from Return Paradise Maybe expecting too much positive side Danes Beckinsale Pullman were fantastic their roles Although didnt like Daness character first found her very annoying couldnt see anything realistic about film could been done much better for example there could been more emphasis prison conditions sheer horror too cheery movie realistic There could also been more action tension best thing about film tragic ending couldnt predicted But time really didnt care what happened them 310
