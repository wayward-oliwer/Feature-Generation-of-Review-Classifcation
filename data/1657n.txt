possible spoiler two Soul Survivors quite possibly worst theatrical released movie ever Nothing makes sense all theres some plot about girl who strange visions people who may may not dead entire movie just bunch random shots things dont really tie together end film Tha acting nonexistent camera work jerky script confusing just makes movie even harder watch kept waiting for something tie movie together but nothing came Definitely worst film year stars
