Takashi Miikes incursion into kiddie territory won over almost immediately because demonstrates nerve bravery dealing with fantasy elements fairy tale dares dark Even kid thought there something sinister about most fairy tales horrible things happen people most childrens books Miike understands these classic tales are bit scarier more disturbing than what they appear first glance filmmaker takes archetypical story kid wondrous quest out preschool classroom accentuates very real fears world filled with neverending hazardous missions Westerners like downplay seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids appreciated fact Miike more honest than most American filmmakers goes for jugular story but also shows signs restrain But selfpossessed Miike still stranger than most filmmakers thought great film Highly recommended
