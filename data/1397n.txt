weekend just passed watched Weeks Later which very good After watched film have tell you one most boring called horror you could ever watch scenes were unrealistic there script plot alien creature unreal fight scenes mild compared school yard fight make worse guy named Cody had uncontrollable loose filthy tongue which distracts attention from main film Forget about movie rather watch Weeks Later Cheers Mesake
