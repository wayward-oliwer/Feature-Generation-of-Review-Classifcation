Take your basic Frankenstein flick inject some Reanimator but not good parts you have Doctor Hackenstein Certainly obviously inspired aforementioned films but never materializes anything special own scientist accidentally kills wife whole movie takes place over course one night attempts revive wife revive wife decides chop off body parts from some women have become stranded coincidentally decide stay night place cant really say acting bad nor directing Everything here just way too standard What little attempts there are humor actually work check out scene when Hackenstein keeps hiding behind deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly very upset she saw him clutching woman needle but hardly enough recommend film music decent what blood there decent cast looks quite good for half time even entertained film But never felt like anything more than time waster Avoidable Try Frankenhooker instead
