husband huge Robin Williams fan like him too but have generally found should stick what does best focus comedic roles thoughts were confirmed with movie completely bored throughout entire film story predictable realize inspired true story But guess there could have been some suspense intrigue even while maintaining truth story None characters were well developed There side story about main character partner relationship could have been explored further More important though would have been deeper exploration mother boy Her psychological profile would have been interesting delve into She obviously long history not touched upon except most superficial way husband wasnt such huge Williams fan would have left minutes into Too bad cant get hours back
