Man really find hard believe wonderful Alan Ball had anything with mess Having seen first two episodes thus far think can safely say show isnt must see list just got many things working against None actors cast are particularly good Anna Paquin lead character Sookie just remember her better lot other things Ive seen her maybe just writing Shes not really much fun look either there are moments where honest she looks downright ugly actor who plays Bill marginally better only because character supposed sort wooden aloof other actors their best but with clich√© characters with difficult perform accents they are given tough job Tara absolute misery watch Rutina Wesley absolutely murders accent like nails chalkboard bad Almost Nelsan Ellis difficult understand what even saying sometimes Both character well Taras also seem bit racist dont know having character say whycome HBO show isnt Wire just seems bit odd Rounding out cast far are Sookies doddering grandmother her sex addict brother only bit genius casting Ive seen William Sanderson sheriff story seems meandering towards destination point with real worry about keeping viewer interested romance stuff very Dark Shadowsy Although show camp factor from something like those old Dark Shadows episodes times about ten times seemed campy just have assume intended But unlike show such Buffy pulled camp off masterfully show does not Out place with campiness extreme gore graphic sex show not averse either these when they are done well they have many other HBO shows but here least they prolonged rough sex scenes involving Jason Stackhouse seem bit over top pointless About only nice thing can really think say about mess liked opening title sequence HBO had string bad luck with their shows lately hope they cancel after first season try get something better air
