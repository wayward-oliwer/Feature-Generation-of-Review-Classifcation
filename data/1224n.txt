would have one worst not worst movie Ive ever nearly seen couldnt watch all way through Purely simply gratuitous violence just for sake ridiculous story line only adds lacklustre incompetent filming Sick only suitable for those with love for manic mutilation After murdering several hundred men women children Seed finally caught after effortlessly killing several more police officers finally get tip whereabouts sentenced death electric chair miraculously survives Buried alive digs way out plots revenge against those put him away flicked switch Needless say more gruesome murders ensue
