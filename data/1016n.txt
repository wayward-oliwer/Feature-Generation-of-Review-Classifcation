watched movie for project love please tell Nicolas Cage learn what would feel like character then reread lines saying life cannot accidentally cut off own handmy brother close Obviously fault since when have happy endings included nice guy who takes care Mom sad alone closure bad script doesnt have enough extension minor characters Save yourself unless your for good laugh Costumes were done appropriately extras did fabulous job sure would have been fun movie make but keep more genre specific cant recommend movie anyone know because not intellectual movie not chick flick not strict romantic cant show kids because sex questions follow All all just not good flick
