Went watch movie expecting nothing really much action flick still got very disappointed opening scene promised little action with tinge comedy keeps you hooked for first half coz till then you are expecting now time for action kick Well nothing sort happens movie drags ending just thumps you down point you get annoyedWonder what director thinking Made sense watsoever movie lacked all aspects had real storyline seemed very hollow even Rambo dont think could have helped rating all There simply logic movie perfect way waste your time money far most irritating movie have ever seen sure there will others wholl have same viewpoint after enduring Definitely not for people who have little movie sense left them
