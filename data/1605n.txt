movie had what sounded like good premise people facing their fears win one million dollars Unfortunately did not turn out good movie There are several scenes are way too long really pointless like dancing scene few scenes are just excuse point camera female body parts acting bad but some lines are amusing their Whats really strange towards end movie turns into like minute western end twists which their were several dont make sense with rest movie seemed though director just stuff because thought would look cool while conveniently ignoring plot movie point just didnt make lot sense only creepy thing old people dancing down hall but doesnt even come close making for rest mess
