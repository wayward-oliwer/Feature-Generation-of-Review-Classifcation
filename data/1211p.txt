Ive never been fan Farrah FawcettUntil now She truly amazing movie emotion she must have gone through shooting retake after retake doesnt bare thinking about very hard movie watch subject matter decidedly unpleasant you feel helpless just sitting watching woman abused for what seems like eternity actually felt whole thing deflated somewhat when her friends returned house didnt find conclusion all plausible director seemed very keen using height shots loved using mirror reflections believe should have paid more attention pace second half piece sure makes heck powerful piece theatre movie for although had merit just fell short
