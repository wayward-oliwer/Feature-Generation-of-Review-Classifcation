interested seeing movie because knew Christian based director had good ideaintentions when making movie but could have been better can understand why someone would still have feelings for who they believe greatest love their life However didnt understand why director made friends insensitive mean rude main character kept apologizing friends when they were ones mean him They werent understanding all they used God reason explain their behaviors main character nor anyone else didnt know exgirlfriend divorced still married etc but they were against him resolving old feelings needed dealt with friends were suppose Christians should have been portrayed supportive whether they agreed with decision not many times things life where dont apologize those have hurt past when trying they were all against him ironic part new female friend accused him having stalking behavior for simply looking old friend when she did really odd thing get hold name address phone numbershe seemed stalker she didnt seem like friend all but only looking out for herself God loveand think God wants people with person they were meant with feel movie did terrible injustice making seem like God doesnt care about true loveonly you stay with someone you made bad choice with all make mistakesits all about what steps you take make amends Like said movie had potential but tired onesided point view constantly repeated jammed down viewers throat socalledwellmeaning friends movie didnt hold true Christian belief love but give for effort
