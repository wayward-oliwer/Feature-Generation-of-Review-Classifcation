film decided see because huge fan adult animation quite often find when film doesnt evolve around famous actor actress but rather story style allows film viewed piece art rather than showcase actors ability differ styles film certainly more about style than story While found story interesting thriller borrows story atmosphere from films such Blade Runner many anime films bit hard follow times didnt feel like all came together well could have definitely had mixed sense French Animation Japanese Anime coming together Whether good thing not viewer Visually film treat for eyes sense work art you like adult animation would like see film different from most films out moment would recommend All can say enjoyed experience film but did come away slightly disappointed because could have been better
