madeforTV rather needless Scifi Channel retelling Beowulf story especially after recent 2005 film Beowulf Grendel movie doesnt really get into Beowulfs story but just takes through battle against ravenous beast known Grendel leaves kingdom absolute fear turmoil while powerful viking warrior Beowulf called upon rid them monsters rampage successfully accomplished king will longer have sacrifice children keep bay After few failed attempts creature slain but angry vengeful mother soon attacks leaving Beowulf again lend mighty acts bravery strength defeat Grendel looks like shot tiny budget effects are terrible Like said movie absolutely needless
