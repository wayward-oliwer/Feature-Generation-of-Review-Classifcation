CIA CodenameAlexa absolute horrible rip off Luc Bessons classic film Femme Nikita1990 film basically about woman who taken trained CIA forced secret mission for them Pretty much same story structure Femme Nikita acting combo Lorenzo Lamas Simpson perhaps worst cinema history Lamas acting simply bad Steven Segal impersonation Watching Orenthal act film excruciating experience writing acting poor film times laughable There are many action movie conventions film ridiculous unnecessary car explosions people flying thru glass windows terrorists bad ponytails etc musical score resembles David Michael Franks score for Hard Kill 1990 which furthers Steven Segal theme movie There plenty martial arts film pretty well done for low budget American production mindless action over top acting never lets have admit mildly entertained Lorenzo Lamas had look action star back early but certainly action star why soap operas not action blockbusters recommendation you skip CIA CodenameAlexa check out Femme Nikita instead
