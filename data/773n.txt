Theres really way beat around bush saying Lady Death Motion Picture just plain sucks Aside from fact main character well endowed blonde running around Hell leather bikini with occasional spurts graphic violence movie seems have been made with mentality 1980s cartoon based line action figures bad guy himself even talks like Skeletor wannabe obligatory inept henchman lives lair looks have been patterned after domain villain from old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon Just dont expect any humor other than sometimes howlingly bad dialogue other times feels like kind anime tale better suited hentai yet there sex tentacle rape Thank goodness very little sex appeal despite physical appearance title character There simply adult edge material unless you count halfnaked heroine bloody deaths Essentially what have here feature length episode SheRa Princess Power but with skimpier clothes more gore
