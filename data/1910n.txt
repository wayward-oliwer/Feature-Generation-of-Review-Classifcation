cant say Wargames Dead Code worst movie Ive ever seen had one two decent moments but can easily say most transparent movie Ive ever seen Not once did plot device present itself without guessing minutes advance There subtlety anything movie did intelligence evident all behind scenes Every spoken typed lines intent glaringly obvious impossible get into movie found myself laughing horribly thought out plot line bumbled attempts reclaim audience far more often than found myself enjoying movie
