First let say director some wonderful use titles establishing shots really enjoyed them really enjoyed movie but got say next Pierce Brosnan Greg Kinear pretty lackluster Brosnan melts into character well really hard remember same guy played bond also shows range depth actor kinda indie flick really nice see especially with all mainstream movies flood movies time year found characters well crafted twist middle felt especially good also liked how characters come off realistically many times have film these caricatures people are not really characters but walkingstereotypes like different approaches movie takes think sideways when think movie but think more watchable better movie overall
