thought very clunky uninvolving version famous Australian story Heath Ledger Orlando Bloom were very good their roles gave their characters some personality but whole thing felt forced mechanical beginning could have been lot more involving perhaps starting with shootout then flashing back for recap how they got there sort thing felt like every scene routinely predictable signposted like very bad soap really looking forward movie hoping for something lot better only thing can say favour beats Mick Jagger version but not much
