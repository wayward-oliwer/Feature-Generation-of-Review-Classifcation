guessing reason movie did well box office course Eddie Murphy think first movie since Beverly Hills Cop time hot Considering one made over two hundred million one made about million does say not all popular have never been big Eddie Murphy fan probably another reason didnt care for much all one Eddie some sort finder lost kids must find golden child world terrible peril plot very bad but bad does not compare special effects had seen better stuff done than some stuff one offers Ray Harryhausen did better stuff Still main reason you see movie like because Eddie unfortunately not very funny one all just seems stupid put him Raiders Lost Ark type scenes guess they were hoping for fish out water effect but just did not work
