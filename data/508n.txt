Well bought Zombie Bloodbath trilogy thinking would mindless gory fun what without fun film truly mindless absent any plot character development any sort storyline basic problem with movie kills gore Basically every kill looks EXACTLY same ZOmbies ripping someone apart Yeah okay but you need some original kills too mean got really lame every kill looked exactly same filmed exactly same way what killed love gore gore film did nothing for just boring storyline just same lame scene over over again with different person wanted like movie too love shot video gore movieslike Redneck Zombies But couldnt kid myself film good points but none those are film understand many zombies helped out with flood there were like over 100 zombies which pretty cool how they got many people involved helped out world But overall terrible film
