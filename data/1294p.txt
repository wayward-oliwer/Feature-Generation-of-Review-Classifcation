Mitchell Leisens fifth feature director shows versatility directing musical after previous movies were heavy dramas also plays cameo conductor You can tell pre code movie nothing like made for quite while afterwards like years Leisen shot musical numbers they were like what audience would see widescreen shots from above ala Busby Berkeley What find funny interesting you never actually see audience others have mentioned leads are fairly characterless Jack Oakie Victor McLaghlan play their normal movie personas Gertrude Michael however provides bit spark musical numbers are interesting some good Rape Rhapsody particular amusing but drama unconvincing faked three murders too many have minimal emotional impact characters where movie could have been lot better
