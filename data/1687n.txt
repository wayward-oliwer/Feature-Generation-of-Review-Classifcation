doesnt quite plumb depths Creepshow but comes close also uses same technique using some same actors multiple roles throughout anthology which distracting say least also rather irritating rips off Twilight Zone with bookshop comparable Serlings later Night Gallery Unfortunately producers writers forgot Serling would build sympathy for characters before messing them over None characters are particularly sympathetic interesting until last segment Framing story Adam West well himself doesnt Bruce WayneBatman campy route but rarely does simply plays notparticularlyenigmatic Jay theres ominous spinechilling name compare likes Terror Eramus Cryptkeeper makes some mildly awkwardcreepy statements Abernathy Seen Rod Serlings Stop Willoughby Then youve seen red herring nutso wife introduced purpose but even main characters friend identifies him wimp well directed can expected but basically incoherent Nexs Diner Reminiscent various Serling time travel stories mixed with Steve Allens Meeting Minds Most actors arent too bad except for Josh Astin Cassius who manages walk talk even breathe awkwardly idea mildly interesting But like Abernathy doesnt anywhere main character raises some relatively reasonable questions bugs out bit who wouldnt for some reason ends banished nuclear wasteland Life Replay Not bad little piece manages predate both Click Creepshow suppose says something people are fascinated magical properties remote controls main character mildly sympathetic Nothing substantially innovative here but okay Fighting Spirit You see twist coming mile away but like main character some heart decent story defeat redemption Finale why people end cold storage silver lame suits Dont know doesnt make sense all protagonists wandered into bookstore became trapped Kinda undermines happy ending with boxer thanks guys guy first segment died how did get trapped Did visit bookstore before died got trapped didnt die What Huh supposer isnt expected make sense because supernatural But still Overall basically not dissimilar from two newer Twilight Zone series some episodes Tales From Darkside Monsters last two stories part second are probably worth your time But theres nothing really spectacular here
