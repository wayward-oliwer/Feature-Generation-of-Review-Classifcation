What you call horror story without horror story most irritating thing about film get feeling writers never really decided whats actually film different thing know give hints for audience not completely reveal but here you get feeling screenwriters dont know characters film not know audience sees one knows Remember Cube Even film knew more about itself Ive consumed lot horror gore films movie certainly roots deep those films But lot important things are missing really know nothing about characters They keep repeating empty lines over over again story isnt really developing never goes anywhere Bacting type horror films but theres not much act script dont care about characters Theres nothing remember about them Theres not even cheesy humor unnecessary sex most importantly thrills chills You only get some commonly used elements horror film genre They show Lordi monsters one one but their characters dont really contribute anything for story honestly believe amount story character development atmosphere could achieved with minimal amount crew equipment yeah film makers used more some years ago felt shared embarrassment audience film ended Too bad really
