Bad plot though good for Bmovie good fastpaced fight scenes most out But something always bothered about film how come Mariska Hargitay never speaks version she shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman even kiss garden Yet regular video version most her scenes are cut she never speaks all bothers because not only takes out female though cliched pointofview film also makes final shot seem creepy film would have been better had they kept her scenes because those scenes least she personality one undercuts whatever Speakman says
