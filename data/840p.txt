Even though quite young Beatles are ABSOLUTELY FAVOURITE band never had chance hear their music releases but have loved them since can remember sort film worth trying once can see why wasnt released cinema but certainly great film put flicking through guide happened see film didnt much details except something like John Lennon Paul McCartney meet after Beatles have broken Jared Harris Stars never heard him played John Aiden Quinn who played Paul However they are certainly underestimated actors film had slow start but developed could see how well Quinn but especially Harris played their characters huge fan sort know what real Lennon McCartney are like script brilliant Harris got Lennons accent personality mannerisms spot Quinn played McCartney quite well but sometimes went into Irish accent makeup artists made them look excellent PARAGRAPH MAY COUNTED SPOILER mentioned before got off slow start but soon developed became quite emotional film found bit park total waste time quite out character for both musicians for Lennons rude line Italian restaurant totally unnecessary ending very poignant brings tear eye whenever watch quite different from other biographical films Ive seen where about how Beatles got together became famous those never really did characters well Backbeat conclusion would say youre Beatles John Lennon Paul McCartney fan give chance you may have pleasent surprise only about minutes long worth waiting for film develop anyone does know whether meeting 1976 really did happen please send comments page for film very interested
