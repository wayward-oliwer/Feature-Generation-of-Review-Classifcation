Very good except for ending which huge disappointment script very good acting visuals were often very grainy but way film snowy features were good places helped create mood towards film affect ruined extremely unbelievable ending give film out ten but ending knocked down point because seemed depart radically from first minutes movie seemed quite forced end make film makers look clever movie though much better than films with quite lot larger budgets seemed filmed like home movie with some extra equipment Not much way special effects these but for suspense very good
