Now Ive always been fan Full Moons puppet work But have say Robot Jox one there better projects you heard story works wonderful atmosphere really works actors first rate job Gary Graham who really makes mark shows like ALIEN NATION SERIES STAR TREK ENTERPRISE shows can action star who kicks ass takes name stop motion effects could have been tiny bit better color wrong they look plastic instead metal they were suppose But minor complaint compared whole Robot Jox you like Gary Graham other Full Moon movies then you will like movie STARS OUT
