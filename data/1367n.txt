movie disappointment looking forward seeing good movie type person who starts movie doesnt turn off until end but forcing myself not turn off Theonly reason why didnt turn off because huge Christian Slater fan wanted see him act really speechless after finished watching movie movie one worst movies have seen life Thank you Christian Slater for putting some humor into you hadnt been movie would been bored out mind also agree Anthony Hopkins needs stick acting time movie over didnt even get plot both confused annoyed
