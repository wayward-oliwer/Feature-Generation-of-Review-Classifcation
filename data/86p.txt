had never heard film before couple weeks ago but concept interested when heard American man meets European woman last night Europe they spend night together talking sparked interest but never expected great Before Sunrise masterpiece also one most romantic films record surprise completely lacked cynicism 1990s impossible really talk too much about since there real plot speak although there are plenty thoroughly interesting things you could talk about sort like Dinner With Andre where there conversation but not JUST conversation matters but let just say see SEE
