After having seen loved Postal actually loved Postal decided try another Uwe Boll film picked out Seed because happened stumble local DVDstore supposed one better films While first minutes film were very promising seemed like beginning not too mainstream psychological thriller soon went downhill from there eventually degraded into one most generic slasher films Ive seen far including massive amount plot holes unrealistic emotional responses subpar acting seems like Boll tried best come with decent plot but after while just gave Maybe should stick comedy few good things about film does manage create overall creepy atmosphere special effects are better than expected soundtrack does well with overall atmosphere but unbalanced pacing film combined with utter generic nature thereof makes last half hour quite tedious watch which ruined experience altogether There are very fairly well done shocking scenes but they seem there for shock value alone lets not forget camera work pretty nauseating times hope Uwe Boll will one day learn what makes good film because between lot horrible films does seem make decent film every now then Seed just isnt one those
