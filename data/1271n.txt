people who are praising film are real disappointments hoping least Leonard will see some good out life savings were embezzled away manager couple years ago over now But film simply terrible beginning Leonard himself says not sentimental about past then for next hour half film emphasizes all worst sentimental elements Leonards songs bloody PRECIOUS with endless closeups over emoting singers Cohens interview all done lofi video closeups wanted see medium long shot whole body couldnt care less about comments performers especially those overblown ego boys Edge Bono None performers film have done even one song good Leonards own music you are thinking about seeing you have any doubts all heed them would acceptable special maybe for one time showing But will even hesitate getting DVD When film finally shows Leonard semiperforming Tower Song ruined Bono taking verse Even occasional good performances Antony Rufus first number Marthas Traitor are spoiled context rest turgid blabla Forget one buy Leonards most recent album you want pay tribute him
