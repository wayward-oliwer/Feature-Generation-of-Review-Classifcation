really enjoyed movie acting adult actors great although did find main kid little stiff But carried himself very well for new talent humor very sublime not your face like most Hollywood comedy junk Nutty Professor you have short attention span are used typical Hollywood stuff you probably wouldnt like bit slower paced picked Bluray have say image quality top notch Probably one better looking Blurays Ive seen far extras were cool too They deleted quite bit but probably good thing most deleted scenes didnt really add anything
