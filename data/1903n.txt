bunch kids set theatre have allnight horror movie marathon However night goes theres somebody among them killing them off one one Who itand why saw theatre way back 1991 looking forward itbut boy did not work all premise good one they have very appealing young cast some pros like Dee Wallace Stone boardbut doesnt work story stops making sense halfway through could because some huge editing before film released killings are relatively bloodless how got rating beyond unmasking killer end boring stupid really too badthis movie had potential With better script could have become great horror film stands though mostly forgotten cast itself seems embarrassed heard Stone wont talk about one give just for cast
