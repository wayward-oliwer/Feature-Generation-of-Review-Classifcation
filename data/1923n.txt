Okay absolutely LOVE Ben Stiller although lukewarm about Jennifer Aniston not think girl can act least Every movie sitcom Ive seen her very hard get past her fake acting sounds like she just standing there reading right off script movie only had one good thing about Ben Stiller plot used abused ridiculous How many movies have same type plot Can say Forces Nature Not only plot old but outcome predictable boring knew everything happen before did bore but watching Stiller always delight
