Maybe because looked history Irish troubles 1920s then sad Civil War engulfed Free State after signing treaty before watching movie Anyway sudden turn end brought tears eyes Victor McLaglen isnt famous today back then should better remembered film think playing himself would have been without innate talent brains For example scenes where buddy crowd challenging men fight with him probably quite reminiscent what McLaglen actually did earlier years when worldclass bareknuckles boxer John Ford partly responsible for IMDb trivia section shows how tricked McLaglen into getting really bad hangover for trial scene director also could bring out lot actors even without such tricks Mostly though McLaglen firmly control especially when character almost totally blotto which difficult for actor believably also plays Gypo Nolan with depth emotional power surprising for someone who only seen McLaglen later career Quiet Man especially like contrast between role IRA man much more obviously controlled performance gave IRA man Denis Hogan Hangmans House Quiet Man course McLaglen country squire odds with local IRA Victor McLaglen big bully oldfashioned sense word but good actor too capable wide range fine nuances performance just wouldnt expect such man today rather sad comment our own set expectations prejudices Ford usual packs lot into little bit film All characters are excellent though Commandants mostly American accent distracting NOTE There spoilers ahead Knowing Gypo once drew short straw ordered kill man but let him talk way out instead really empathize with man who draws short straw for executing Gypo humanity shows most notably when they take Gypo Marys room John Ford really shows genius here taking what could have been gruesome yet expected outcome whole story instead using set totally unexpected yet very satisfying ending makes think not just Gypo other characters but poor Ireland during tortured time
