Greetings again from darkness Insight into mind motivation wonderful artist How strange for most see someone who MUST work matter conditions else reason for living ceases see Goldsworthys sculptures come alive see reaction each extremely voyeuristic artist creates because must not for money fame lifeforce When you see failures energy seems expel from body like burst hot air balloon not dread beginning again takes energy from work Watching him create just have nature takeover recall work somewhat painful but nonetheless breathtaking discusses flow time minimal dialog there appears little doubt artist earth are one same When says needs earth but does not need him beg differ Only complaint musical score seems slow down further pace relaxing best
