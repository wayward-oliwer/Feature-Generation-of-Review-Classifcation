Pretty disappointing prequel first two films got none suspense first nor interest second concentrating guys who run cube basically takes away any sense tension inside cube simply dont care about characters inside Much film simply boring only becomes truly terrible with introduction glasseyed superior greeneyed crazy marine After though just descends into overthetop unintentional hilarity ending fitting though tying back into first one indirect way script terrible acting mediocre best direction unimpressive much lesser followup
