one film wanted watch always when released promos were eye catching Govinda negative role surprise But film isnt good lot flaws start good till murder everything goes well but film falls flat when romance track starts between Govinda Karisma songs follow Then twist about Govinda Tabu love leaves more doubts flaws then How come Govinda turns into rich criminal from poor villager last flashback too prolonged also entire clash between GovindaKarisma Tabu Chandra disappoints Music okay Bahot Khoobsurat stands out Govinda tries negative role does very well though overdoes too much times Karisma good but irritates times with her cries Tabu okay Nirmal Pandey still doesnt know difference between loud screaming acting rest are okay
