Rookie suffers from much There are random musical songs interspersed through movie long pointless script enough grating slapstick make Jerry Lewis blush Noonan Leavitt just dont know when quit takes full hour before story finally gets main plot characters are shipwrecked Then guys start playing Japanese sailors with standard racist caricature day shame funniest parts movie are when Noonan Leavitt are playing stupid stereotyped Japanese guys But gets pretty tiring after switching back forth between two sets characters Then just abruptly ends Even naked Julie Newmar towel cant save one There really little charm movie over half hour too long story just flounders along trying set funny situations failing Stick Martin Lewis least Deano had charm Jerry had animated face
