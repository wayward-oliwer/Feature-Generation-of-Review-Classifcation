After promising first minutes makes you feel all warm inside youre pretty convinced will great romantic comedy Then movie takes turn for worse warm feeling might still there but others said plot becomes unbelievable artificial almost unbearable watch movie gets sped you get impression youre either fast forwarding through producers decided fit less than 1h40m had cut lot scenes out Realism isnt goal onto itself but viewer pretty convinced comedy isnt intentionally unrealistic just happens plus side movie couple nice interiors despite bad script think actors performances are mainly good could rate first minutes only probably give eight now gets four nice youre sucker for romantic comedies youll probably have great time anyways not recommend you watch something else
