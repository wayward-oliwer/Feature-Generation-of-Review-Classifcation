Ted Mikelss film Corpse Grinders 103 minutes excruciating cinematic swill plot pretty much mixture nonsensical business dealings among people who grind corpses into cat food while cat aliens who are losing war with dog aliens looking get some cat food Watching movie began look for any kind distraction anything reassure myself something else besides losing mind from inside out Several scenes for far too long characters take forever simple things Ive heard Mikels doesnt like use jump cuts too often fearful they will confuse audience not sure attitude avantgarde just stupid Try might could not bring myself care about any characters unnecessarily huge cast well with possible exception old men who are caretakers factory majority cast are bunch notalent amateurs who dont even bother learn lyrics Amazing Grace before they have sing camera Although perhaps blame should poor sound quality since only actually heard around dialogue while watching DVD quite possibly worst film ever shot Ive listened snippets commentaryand Mikels comes off surprisingly sweet old man what hell making kind trash like hear explanations from old men who had lie shirtless metal conveyor belt waiting ground Movies Ive long hated suddenly seem lot better long for intermittedly appropriate music Excalibur consistent lighting Dawn Dead need something anything Dont see movie
