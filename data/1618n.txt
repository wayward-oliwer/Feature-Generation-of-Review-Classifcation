premise awaited sequel really good after huge success remake expected lot sincerely sad truth movie really absurd inept situations are dumb beyond reason acting truly time there arent likable characters violins unlike remake Also gore not abundant when happens truly bad violence minimal shame because there are many arguments make you think theres room for heavy violence mean theres SWAT team hunting family cannibal mutants You surely expect something different When watched movies wanted money back Anyways clear example how rushed out movies turn out mess demonstrate poor quality all aspects mess let down fans remake like why sequels are never welcomed least movie isnt terrible 1985 sequel original
