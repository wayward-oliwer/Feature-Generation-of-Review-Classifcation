somewhat fictionalized biographical portrait Abraham Lincolns early years from Director John Ford concentrating primarily trial which young lawyer defends two brothers accused murder film offers interesting portrayal important American figure film well made but seems somewhat incomplete without any great moments from presidency even debates with Stephen Douglas obvious intent portray Lincoln young man developing attributes would make him great man would become But result for while admired portrayal just wasnt satisfying think could have been with greater scope role Abraham Lincoln have Henry Fonda who effectively displays quiet strength Fondas performance includes some gangly mannerisms other affectations which are fairly effective presenting portrayal Lincoln particularly when combined with some effective makeup costuming which occasionally bit overt supporting cast solid surprisingly does not include many Fords regular supporting cast sometimes referred stock company but have Ward Bond one most prolific character actors Hollywood Bond appeared more AFI Top 100 Films than any other actor both original revised list also appeared Best Picture Nominees film features one scene would seem have inspired quite similar scene Kill Mockingbird where would done even better than here even though scene one most effective film
