really have problems rating movie directed brilliantly there obviously lot money Gere Danes are intense although her screen personality could use bit more defining spicing editing cinematography are excellent other hand one those really really sick movies where one cannot help but wonder whether director himself likes stage specific scenes one cannot help but wonder how many copycats will such movie inspire purely artistic terms but really have ask myself who these people are giving their money produce such movie
