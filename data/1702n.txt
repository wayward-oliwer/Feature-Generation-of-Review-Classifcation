Cedric Kahns films have been characterbased rather than actionbased thinking LEnnui Feux rouges jarring see series really expert car chases interspersed with some plodding attempts give character Succo dont find Stefano Cassetti interesting actor reminds pro athletes who are coaxed into movies like Bret Favre blank stare looks like really vicious deer caught headlights real actor would have forced reflect more Succos personality rather than admiring skill carjacking little acting there comes mainly from Isild Besco needy schoolgirl Succo takes storm interview police office marvel bland obstinacy with little fear future blended Besco apart there little recommend film
