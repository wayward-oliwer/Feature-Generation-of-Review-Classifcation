not horror first part campy light humorous entertainment Like many sequels action starts right away with explanations But theres boobs dont complain real boobs understand correctly those are quite rare today amongst teenage girls Which brings mind fact main actress here Pamela Bruces sister Springsteen cannot thought without first movie compare Again there too small clothing mainly pants funny hair not hard tell what decade film made Again there really strange characters time even more visibly pathological ones Especially personnel camp like some mental rehabilitation summer camp People are older Most actors must least but think theyre supposed something Some methods used Evil Dyke are quite unpleasant Actually movie dont have much common with first part worse than every way
