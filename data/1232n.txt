movie lot like movie Hostel except with BAD acting not much suspense gore elements are there but you dont really feel anything for characters making violence not very effective Some parts are just strange like forcing snake down someones throat Whats with supposed scary gory just kind stupid for torture there really isnt any except for guy getting blowtorched beginning which they dont show anyway main bad guy keeps saying make them die slowly yet butcher kills them all very fast deaths are all relatively quick did watch unrated version overall not worst gore movie Ive seen but not all good either You wont miss anything you skip one
