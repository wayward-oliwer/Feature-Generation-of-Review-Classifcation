said before visual effects are stunning Theyre breathtaking personally use Blender graphics like are not easy ALL But all movie Not only plot confusing but overall conflict not clear For example first scene Proog Emo are trying run away from who knows what conflict seems between man nature here Later when they enter room bottomless pit Proog explains one step out place youre dead Here theres more precise conflict between careless man nature movie progresses clear conflict exists between man nature But suddenly conflict exists between man man when Proog out nowhere murders Emo Proog immediately changes from caring guardian looking after lost child sick man betrays Not only depressing but dont care because conflict between characters thoughts actions not developed not story about someone through struggle emerging stronger depressing not point because theres great truth about human soul about world brought light like great drama does opinion movie severely underdeveloped all aspects However graphics are stunning but movie much more than mere eye candy Theres truth struggle bad surprise ending conclusion underdeveloped movie without point but graphics are good
