Uggh really wasnt impressed film though must admit technically well made does get for very high production values but for entertainment values rather poor fact consider one most overrated films won Oscar for Best Picture but film just boring times with much dancing dancing dancing because unlike some musicals have reasonable number songs along with strong story acting such MEET LOUIS movie almost all singing dancing fact film about longest song dance number history you arent into film will quickly bore you Give more story result with overblown production numbers weak story film like steady diet meringueit just doesnt satisfy long run thinkthis film beat out Streetcar Named Desire Place Sun for Best Picture make matters worse African Queen Ace Hole werent even nominated category Even more amazing Ace Hole lost for Best Writing Screenplay filmeven though American Paris had hardly any story speak mostly driven dance song
