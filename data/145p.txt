would reccomend film everyone Not only fans rocker Luciano Ligabue but all filmbuffs Because sincere moving funny true Because Ligabue born storyteller film lover every frame film made with love care Because characters are loved ask loved Because most Italian debut films are lousy one done outsider real joy watch listen Because Stefano Accorsi gorgeous reminds Andrea Pazienza who like Freccia beautiful talented good lost life because heroin Ligabue shows unglamorous ugly without indulging easy moralisms Because film speaks our heart our ears our souls because lived experience radios exactly like Thanks Luciano
