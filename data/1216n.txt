Predictable told thousand times story with usual drama between couple pretty raunchy sex scenes intermingled with some character paranoia style incidental violin horror music comical times couldnt help chuckling myself usually like Defoe said acting not all bad plot develops reasonable pace does keep you guessing from time time just all too predictable felt like watching made for drama instead new movie Maybe style directors wanted but said review read here before saw movie could only have been written someone involved production Dont expect too much could wind clock back wouldnt have gone see cinema would wait for bargain bins your video shop sure wont take long
