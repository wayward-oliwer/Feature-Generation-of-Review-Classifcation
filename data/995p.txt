Attention Spoilers First all let say Rob Roy one best films amazing achievement for all those involved especially acting Liam Neeson Jessica Lange John Hurt Brian Cox Tim Roth Michael Canton Jones painted wonderful portrait honor dishonor men can represent themselves But alas constantly unfairly gets compared Braveheart These are two entirely different films probably only similar fact they are both about Scots historical Scotland Yet comparison frequently bothers because seems almost assumed Braveheart better film than Rob Roy like Braveheart lot but idea comparing Rob Roy little insulting put quite simply love Braveheart but pale shadow how much love Rob Roy Here are particular reasons Rob Roy about real people Lets face William Wallace Braveheart not real person legend martyr larger than life figurehead Because depiction also perfect person never wrong basically showing Scot countrymen promised land When finally does fail not fault Like Jesus betrayed very people trusted most even goes through worst kind torture because wants freedom much depiction Wallace very well done effective But really doesnt inspire intrigue find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection why Last Temptation Christ better film than King Kings also one reasons why think Rob Roy better than Braveheart Rob Roy may heroic brave but far from perfect makes several mistakes affected lives many loved ones Now sure not bearing false claim against Duke Argyll act nobility courage but also act egoism self centeredness Let not forget kinfolk had claimed protect were driven homeless end film because act But Rob did best could all you could ask him Robs Wife Mary also normal ambigious person Let start though with how she looks film Sure shes beautiful but she doesnt wear makeup she basically allows her natural beauty show Compare with two loves one depending your point view William Wallace Braveheart Now these two ladies are hot but hardly indicitive how women looked time especially lay persons Maybe not fair comparison but just another example how Rob Roys attempts for accuracy are far more effective Throughout Rob Roy Mary live with her vicious rape dastardly carrion Cunningham She feels compelled tell Rob her struggle but doesnt because she knows Rob must seek revenge for her rape Such revenge would surely mean death Rob Mary not prepared for such sacrifice villains Rob Roy are equally compelling Although enemies Braveheart are well written they are hardly original Robert Bruce man both brave cowardly plagued moral decisions are all familar fictional realm Should take claim king Scotland should betray Wallace order ensure safety family name Bruce most ambigious character Braveheart but from Brutus Julius Ceasar Fredo Godfather Part these types characters are hardly original Longshanks although compelling villain own right very one dimensional epidemy evil tyrant ways stand direct contrast Wallaces heroism Rob Roy three villains are wonderful their chicanery First all lets start with Marquis Montrose man who obsessed with self image willing let innocent man suffer because See not mocked are favorite words factor man obsessed with power upset man great noble bearing Duke Argyll can considered greater providency then him shamefully self obsessed insecure evil aristocrat but ways make him unique Cunningham Callarn are conspirators Rob Roy are also Roys direct assailants Callarn cunning cowardace almost comical will anything maintain good will Marquis which includes backstabbing trickery Cunningham compelling character seems have been raised whatever can obtain status affection Marquis needs father little does know Marquis real father Therefore when opportunity obtain wealth comes from Callarn grabs without even questioning very much like evil modern man self centered vain cares not about consequences actions others Many have criticized Tim Roths performance film overacting Hogwash say clear Cunningham not simply evil but also psychopath throughout film world where man stepson can around shooting random people for amusement Cunningham too much unbelievable character live society where people seem have decreased value human life Rob Roy simply teaches only circumstances decreased value changed problem throughout human history vanity human heart will not allow for capacity for compassion Rob Roy Mary give hope goodness will prevail but snakes will always exist our world Another character find fascinating Duke Argyll true nobleman values honesty courtesy are direct contrast Marquis appreciates bravery Rob Roy Mary direct vexation for Marquis factor gives world hope for people power Hopefully people like Marquis are exception not rule final duel Rob Roy more exciting then battle scenes Braveheart One thing get tired people telling Braveheart better film because battle scenes First all battle scenes are hardly original From Spartacus Gladiator Hollywood had long tradition historical European battle scenes Braveheart some best battle scenes ever put film but they suffer from one important problem These battle scenes have context except for fight for freedom Now dont get wrong duels are hardly original either fact there are probably times many films with duels there are with battle scenes But context duel between Cunningham Rob Roy beauty behold one greatest scenes film history Let explain why First all fighting style bearing two characters duel describe characters perfectly Cunningham effette dangerous Rob Roy strong courageous Cunningham uses fencing sword while Rob uses broadsword Cunningham fights with quick tricky movements while Roys fighting style more obvious whole film from deliberately slow first half exciting second half leading moment powerful stuff clear Rob must exterminate menacing evil plagued whole world When Rob finally gets upper hand literally figuratively one greatest moments film history Rob wins because more live for honor more powerful than Cunninghams use music absolutely chilling scene Good prevailing against real evil more powerful than seeing dude get disemboweled just can yell FREEDOM But hey maybe just Rob Roy more realistic than Braveheart dont know people aristocracy Scotsmen talked like people Rob Roy but feel clearly attempt capture their speech patterns feel many people are bored Rob Roy simply because they cant understand what characters are saying case then read some Shakesphere put closecaptioning Rob Roy actually one greatest written films Many dialogue film clever but maybe you have watch film couple times understand contrast dialogue Braveheart hardly very interesting course what you expect when main character Scotsman played Australian legend there clearly not attempt capture speech times film takes place several centuries before Rob Roy yet they talk like people today Thus reason many people like better Audiences today have become increasingly lazy they dont want take time patience understand things are complex Therefore with many epic films they expect see villians speak recognizable English accent while heroes speak vernacular not too far away from our American language Sure clear Wallace Scotish but other than sounding like Scotty from Star Trek couple Ayes for acknowledgement Scots film fit into Hollywood tradition how believe Scots should sound these descriptions prove Rob Roy better film than Braveheart Hardly But proves one thing shows hardly common knowledge Braveheart better film than Rob Roy put simply Rob Roy film themes are very apropos todays world Braveheart film about legend inspiring but hardly realistic You can make decision what you think better Grade Score
