intrigued see how littleseen 2008 film had somehow won Oscar for best picture 2009 thus went see Hurt Locker sadly all got for two hours invested grim confirmation film had won awards purely for offthescreen reasons direction visual style film some weakest you will ever see when not busy yet another Bourne Identity homage with dire annoying shaky cam visuals shows off all hallmarks second rate daytime soap opera terms lensing plot threadbare characterizations are about well developed rejected Beetle Bailey comic strip ideas dialogue instances where film gives minimalist for apparent reason turns one two soldiers into right chatterboxes some worst ever recorded fairness actors best they can circumstances just not enough obscure how bad project whole film feel intended some kind mockumentary they clocked bereft humour thus reedited best they could pass off serious drama you spend two hours film they are two hours you will never get back two hours wasted you will regret for rest your life
