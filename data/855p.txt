Turned out classy production with what must have been low budget variety characters amazing from axewielding dwarfs 7ft ghouls enjoyed relationship between leads not overly sentimental but romantic enough keep interest also enjoyed mix humour which can very easy get wrong too muchnot enough which meant didnt get too dark nor too spoofy great step from Eaves other efforts Hellbreeder Sanitarium terms storyline production They have great website which worth checking out Cant wait for Bane level improvement continues should fantastic
