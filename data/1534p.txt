isnt always easy explain what movie like but time think Ive found reminded two movies Trainspotting small time criminals scoring some drugs some stupid things Schotland Blair Witch Project because style filming about loyalty between two friends one them coming out jail other one hasnt been caught yet With stolen vehicle they drive through Scottish countryside but than run out petrol they try find some fuel they find farm middle nowhere farmer thinks they want rob him points gun one them Than all goes wrong One friends accidentally shoots farmers daughter they have run What follows man hunt through fields woods Schotland two friends literally have run for their lives Apparently movie shot only days time not exactly unbelievable because biggest part always same place Scottish countryside but still find quite amazing Especially because isnt actually bad movie perhaps not greatest movie ever but they still can proud what they achieved had nice time watching overall enjoyed movie give 710
