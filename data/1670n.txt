Stewart Moss stars scientist who working trip with wife one gets feeling picked for role for ability roll eyes back headimagine auditions for thiscan youno not quite thank you next Anyway bitten bat then either changing into some kind bat creature killing people orhes not For one else sees strange transformations but himself seems think changing because wedding ring pops off when hands turn into claws etc credit movie does kind hold back whether just nuts whether actually transforming into something until almost very end some good locations sort decent atmosphere times but unfortunately none can make for somewhat lame story wonderfully bad acting Kind fun bad good way but leans more towards just plain bad out
