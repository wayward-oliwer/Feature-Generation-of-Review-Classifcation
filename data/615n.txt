liked how started out featuring some decent specialeffects especially for film years old There some pretty impressive scenery However film bogs down fairly early with some very dumb dialog males all try flirt with Anne Francis Altaira Morbius Viewing after long absence fun see Francis again actress who done mostly television shows since film releasedand still acting also interesting see younglooking Leslie Nielsen John Adams who wouldnt have recognized had not been for voice watched half movie before boredom came almost overwhelming had strong desire sleep appreciated them redoing tape stereo but weak effort one those overrated film where elites think heavy thoughtprovoking nonsense only appeared intelligent because rest scifi films were stupid Some early scenes would have looked great wideescreen which didnt have time writing Perhaps another look time 2351 widescreen transfer would make change review
