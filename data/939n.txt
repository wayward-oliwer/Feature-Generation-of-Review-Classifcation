dont normally feel much incentive comment films dont like but case like one just have say something movie terrible illogical stupid There are many flaws storytelling dont even feel obliged elaborate because time for move from experience most annoying point however point film does anyone explain whether motivations for Bacons characters madness are due power trip physiological reaction condition Granted special effects are impressive past Paul Verhoeven done some good stuff directors cut Robocop DVD great However movie stupid generally doesnt come near explaining point technical aspect subject matter instead settles for predictable action without any enjoyment short many other reviews here say wish had read them before Stay away from film
