remember watching prime time when about years old huge comic book reader time anything relating superheroes anticipated heavily end result however underwhelming aware Emma Peel Diana Prince stories they had only recently come end Diana returned her Amazonian form However there little action bored throughout most movie final costume interesting idea but looked more like cheerleader than superhero saw movie again late teen years hadnt improved much Cathy Lee Crosby more familiar thanks Incredible but her acting better script had few good ideas like rogue Amazon decent villain Ricardo Montalban but just didnt come together still boring think they should have built back story better built show into more epic climax too much like bland spy film crossed with superhero story written someone who had never seen comic book Amazon elements were intriguing but needed expanded film did succeed forcing producers back drawing board come with something more faithful bit too camp low budget budget also pretty low here superheroes dont come cheap would nice have movie available DVD only comparison historical document Even Superman available nothing over film except Chris Reeve Gene Hackman worth seeing for curiosity sake for bit inspiration caution for future versions
