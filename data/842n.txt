Ive seen fair share badly thoughtout endings final twists films but dont recall any film committed outright suicide like one did film makers were clearly hoping great twist would surprise all did but perhaps not way directors had hoped left feeling surprised Connery Harris Fishburn Capshaw had anything with turkey individually collectively film until final thirty minutes rather engaging like way story unfolding nature film overall But once twist revealed plot holes inconsistencies were remarkable underlying motive for revenge illconceived ways things neatly worked out for Bobby Earl ridiculously farfetched Whats worse once twist revealed remainder film became excruciatingly predictable Harris gave terrific performance Connery like Morgan Freeman never gives bad performance even movie aint great all all starts well unfolding keeps viewer interested last minutes one most memorable nose dives history cinema
