Ive been using IMDb for few years now but have never written any reviews before However movie disappointed even with modest score time writing couldnt keep quiet anymore Noise story New Yorker Tim Robbinswho perturbed noise pollution takes alterego vigilante Rectifier vandalizes any cars finds with caralarm sounding take name movie somewhat misnomer Although there are one two instances other sources noise addressed mentioned only true focus our protagonist car alarms Car alarms car alarms car alarms There really other focus When movie tries tie other examples noise pollution problem car alarms seems just thrown give merit actions Robbins character were all annoyed noise Nobody likes sound car alarms course all have internal urge take baseball bat shrieking vehicle movie uses fact pretty much fact alone sell movie say pretty much because there also blatantly contrived sexual relationship including completely needless threesome which obviously thrown for those moviegoers who need such things thrown order enjoy movie Honestly eyerolling Robbins character very shortly into movie becomes completely unrelatable seems less decides not put with noise anymore more focusing much noise begun lose sanity first half movie essentially story how turns from just angry carbashing dude into hero little guy Rectifier However transformation doesnt take place just renames himself could for while Annoying generalized social commentary comes every now then add pretentiousness movie selfsatisfied smirk which never quite leaves Robbins face doesnt help either Overall think very obvious what movie trying pretty much shoved down your throat but opinion fails big way Just one guys opinion cheers
