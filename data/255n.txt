enjoyed previous Ittenbach movie seen Burning Moon But while movie rather grim nasty Premutos seems mostly play for laughs While admirable how Ittenbach made movie with money spare time DVD documentary worthwhile see found myself constantly battling not fastforward next gore scene Sure theres gore all you want then ahead enjoy But warned theres inordinate amount lame comedy tedious story exposition Many are comparing Peter Jacksons movies especially Braindead But looking what Jackson did similar budget Bad Taste clear Ittenbach lacking one thing Jackson talent 310 for pretty good plentiful gore effects for getting most out limited resources but not worth money paid for
