real character story driven drama level shames most what see impressed right from start Dont put off your not sci nut like could happening earth fact another galaxy just makes show more interesting there are space ships laser guns None yet anyway far Ive seen s01 e04 gripped wondering whats happen next there are many possibilities cast play there roles with pasion Eric stoltz especially strong show really stands alone well doesnt matter you watched BSG not fact they are quite different Ive read some negative reviews from sci geeks who expected less drama more aliens ray guns etc but would say ignore them really positive start show Lets hope they dont cann after seasons like they normally with good shows these days
