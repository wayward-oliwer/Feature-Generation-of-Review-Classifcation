love book Jane Eyre have seen many versions All have their strong points their faults However one worst have seen didnt care about Jane Rochester Charlotte Gainsbourg Jane almost tolerable certainly looked plain part but she had emotion any her lines couldnt imagine what Rochester saw her brings Rochester William Hurt had even less emotion than Jane were possible How two such insipid people could fall love mystery but certainly didnt hold attention Perhaps director Zeffrelli fell asleep during production Timothy Dalton too handsome for Rochester version far more faithful book but Ciaran Hinds plays perfect Rochester 1997 version which NOT all true book Trying find something positive about movie Geraldine Chaplain perfect her role
