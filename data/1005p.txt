One less widely lauded recent Asian period action affairs Gojoe first slow often curious but overall pretty terrific offering exciting layered beautiful sad say know virtually nothing Buddhist philosophy Japanese history legend surrounds film deeper meanings are lost but even without contextual knowledge still rich fare taking traditional fantasy structure into impactful higher plane story Benkei warrior monk perhaps demon who seeks enlightenment destroying demon Gojoe Bridge Prince Shanao himself mortal seeker after own higher plane but time power demons Thus film becomes matter illusions Benkeis case indecision conflict which real goal self knowledge for Benkei come terms with true nature for Prince Shanao come face face with nature what seeks become Benkei even more hampered here fact dark nature makes him fundamentally odds with world even when not open conflict never ease Director Sogo Ishii handles one epic with measured pace camera work always stylish often frenzied without neglecting need for more sedate moments let location sink there also great use lighting fog give ethereal atmosphere there air fantasy much film but outside overtly supernatural moments down dirty fantasy with more period fell than flights fancy cinematography Makoto Watanbe important here vivid detailed richly evocative affair Actingwise Daisuke Ryu dignified powerful with mysterious savagery Benkei while Tadanobu Asano driven cold arrogance Prince Shanao leads Masatoshi Nagase rounds things out ordinary man smart cynical but still unaware just exactly what stakes are film all fits together well however touch flabby times begins slowly some shots are little drawn out epic fight scenes times longer than strictly necessary for fighting filmed frenetic rather than for actual moves artistic impact but may disappoint regular action fans often obscured objects flashing blades fast moving individuals whirling with deadly force through their adversaries are order day invigorating watch but end could have done with little more traditionalism There some unfortunate cgi bloodshed well somewhat works context but still distracting Overall though found pretty great film not one for regular action fans swordplay enthusiasts seeking another Azumi rather deeper more mystical beast ending particular will not down well with fans more generic wing such fare But for myself really hit spot for those more adventurously inclined might too Well recommended any rate
