saw movie today have say much much better than expected about couple hours before see Personally had some prejudice due language but did totally change idea movie most cases surprisingly good with great actor actress performances story about boy who had dream who did everything reach really touched film which based true story convinced new school psycho headmaster young boy who get known with new teacher bit different one than others about fighting for things even they doesnt seem work out showed how little things can make huge changes many things how difference can sometimes cause difficult situations Also think actor selections succeeded perfectly really felt like you had been some person watching episodes outsider when they happened Before spoil movie with praises have admit there were some things situations didnt look feel realisticlike one where headmaster school beat Frits aka Martin front class end movie really got beaten badly but only thing caused him some blood coming from nose when comparing first beating beginning when Frits got some stitcheswell guess every movie own faultshave say someday somewhere find DVD from store sure thing take with
