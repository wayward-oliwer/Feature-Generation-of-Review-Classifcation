those comments here before mine mostly agree with Edyarbs story script apparently had potential funny but though managing some points other places failed You could see them wanting make joke but one audience laughed Also agree with Edyarbs view end credits leave normal make cool but not what theyve done now gives more negative feeling than what actually had watching movie enjoyed pleasant entertainment for night definitely didnt feel like waste money get ticket best jokes are ones little bit outside expected are fairly mature like Luke Wilsons character Matt asking super chick Pnis bed when she told him shed get him new one after wild night bed ending breaking bed leaving Matt sore cannot however agree with bgs1614who says film could earn rating there absolutely nothing film justify Some sexual acts but nothing explicit only humorous nudity whatsoever Maybe prescreening showed more like compare two recent films went see with expectations whatsoever Superman Returns Click didnt really expect anything from either one big fan original Superman films trailer for Click only showed potentially chauvinistic which wouldnt oppose film Superman surprised with actually having feel goodgoosebumps about seeing first heroic deed like seeing long lost friend feeling happy about But for rest story rather watch Super Exgirlfriend least offers some surprises Click again TOTAL surprise much better deeper than trailer about five minutes away from really excellent movie jokes also work much better than Exgirlfriend both naughty ones more advanced ones Anyway only reason compared these three films they are three last ones Ive seen within very short period also because went all these with basically expectations all rank them Click Girlfriend Superman
