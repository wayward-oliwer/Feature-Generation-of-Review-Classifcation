absurd aside from fellow Australian who reviewed flick cant help but think everyone else who submitted review far some way involved production Elektra considering how generous they were with their praise Admittedly not really fan comicbooktomovie conversions didnt with many expectations yet still found Elektra incredibly underwhelming thing irked most fact there MUCH film which went unexplained left you thinking huh what relevance does have plot how did aspect character come about can only hope these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat Daredevil which have intention seeing Furthermore behaviour characters film appear aboutface random moments suit storyline dont even get started about utterly pointless romantic subplot also still scratching head over fate CaryHiroyuki Tagawas character which seems have gone unexplained can give kudos movie for anything would have fantastic locations which shot but otherwise gained little enjoyment from Elektra know were supposed suspend our disbelief for fantasyaction films but almost everything film improbable confusing even action film standards simply frustrated Well hell least Jennifer Garner looks damn good
