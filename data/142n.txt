Great cast Great acting Unpredictable story line for first half hour really wanting know what happen each these unredeeming characters how their seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined But when writers took out glue start connecting players they mistakenly used super glue brought movie standstill for last two hours kept thinking would get better but only got worse Dont believe reviews waste time Think about Tom Cruise made ugly why gorgeous hunky bartender wearing braces why know had with plot but without them least there would have been one attractive cast member remember
