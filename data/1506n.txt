definitely one weirder movies out there most notable for kicking off decade Bigfoot hysteria also notable for little touches insanity throughout movie especially when dark moody first half replaced MUSICAL INTERLUDE all things another user pointed out one songs dedicated character Travis Crabtree who paddles around canoe for while then leaves never seen again Although painfully dated now still fun scary movie show kids anyone who enjoys either Bigfoot lore hillbilly culture bound get kick out favorite part guy gets scared jumps headfirst through door narrator explains went unconscious from shock say breaking door with head more likely why went unconscious but whatever 410 stars 710 you like bad Americana
