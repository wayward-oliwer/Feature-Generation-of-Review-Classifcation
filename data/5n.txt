rented DVD kind feel bad since Dawson Lugacy are earnest about DVD comments not bad movie exactly but one those films desperately wants deep comment human nature while not realizing story practically genre Plus little simplistic about issue lot ways characters behavior often strains belief say film you would get something out you dont have lot filmTVliteraturelife behind you honest Ive seen almost exactly same story horror comics even Otherwise point been made before more artfully gets big problem which really doesnt have much cinematic interest besides point ends fairly bland movie overall invests everything idea basic story will shocking compelling doesnt really pay off
