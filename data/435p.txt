have read modesty Blaise for several years now collecting numbers strip After fiasco movie made many years ago based first book Modesty Blaise surprised result got good What got movie not based action violence director had focused history psychology How Modesty created based own tale what parts her life affected her nonchildhood think thougths will give greater understanding next hope film simply loved movies oldfashioned style However everything wasnt good gambling wasnt good almost boring unreal acting could have been improved too not thinking bad guy movie felt real only reason there Modesty could have someone tell her story for Also they could have expanded movie showing more about when she builds network but Ill guess for next movie please forgive for bad English
