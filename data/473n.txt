reasons watch knock off err tribute great movie called Se7en while your channel surfing theres nothing else Someone pays you watch yourself favor pop DVD for Se7en rent download iTunes put your Netflix cue skip Flock entirely Flock same story with with few changes Furthermore editing just wreaks Se7en actually ends taking you out story several times worst one probably fly over desert helicopter shots with sounds people people chattering over radio except there are police helicopters flying overhead one Bottom line call blatant knock off you wanna nice you can call tribute film ahead but either way watch Se7en
