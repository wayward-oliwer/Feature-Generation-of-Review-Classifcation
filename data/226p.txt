story extremely uniqueIts about these pilots saving Earth from alien but they have use special speed makes everything around them age rapidlyThe whole series about pilots dealing with loss timefriendsand mentors ending COULD have been fantasticIt started end total down note leave real mark but instead ended super happy Disney note annoyed VERY bad animation decent for but cant compare nowadaysI have also heard many complain about cheesiness nudityI actually found somewhat decentThe nudity for most part warranted except episode where there excess Overall deserves look but ending keeps from classic
