Overall enjoyed film would recommend indie film lovers However really want note similarities between parts film Nichols Closer One scene especially where Adrian Greniers character questioning Rosario Dawsons about her sex life while away remarkably similar scene Closer where Clive Owens character questioning Julia Roberts although acted with less harshness intensity Love Also note Anna name both Dawsons Roberts character Cant coincidence Now Closer based Patrick Marbers play supposedly film loosely based Arthur Schnitzlers Reigen not sure how connection formed Anyone have idea
