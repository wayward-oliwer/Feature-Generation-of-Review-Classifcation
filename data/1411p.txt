big fan fan film noir film Otto Preminger easily stands one best Ive seen Preminger reunited two stars from hit Laura Gene Tierney Dana Andrews for entirely different sort crime film Laura based around love film based around hate watch police detective Mark Dixon copper already suffering scrutiny from superiors for heavy handed tactics accidentally kill suspect try pin murder known criminal man name Tommy Scalisi plot brilliantly worked Preminger excellently balances several plot points but all comes back down main moral implication surrounding our main character fact film set criminal underground means plot given excellent base work from director Otto Preminger expertly captures sleazier side life showing main characters gambling beating one another their women shooting more also helps offset film from earlier Laura which very much set upper class society role Mark Dixon gives Dana Andrews one most interesting parts career Here have character difficult like cold but fact can understand motives ensures easy sympathise with allows audience ability plug into plight character development well timed weve follows character motivations throughout film everything makes sense end costar beautiful Gene Tierney who isnt given much film she Laura film made Tierney linchpin She does well with what shes got however lead duos chemistry excellent Tierney helps complete every scene shes cant say better film than earlier Laura hard act follow but film certainly fits into film noir formula better than Premingers earlier film film also makes good comparison piece for Laura just about everything film opposite 1944 movie yet all strangely familiar Highly recommended all
