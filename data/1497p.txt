one favorite films all time read book liked but movie expands everything book made famous acting fantastic especially from Jon Voight who plays Sir very evil character film certain way storytelling keeps you hooked throughout until end where everything pulled together for great ending also love way directed flashing back forth between modern day Stanleys ancestors stories story written Louis Sachar but seems story made for film Andrew Davis does great job directing definitely recommend anyone who enjoys good movies
