interesting see what director tried with film But problem not very good There nothing really original film while plot well presented main characters were all bit shallow you didnt bother for any them Rather bland sometimes downright bad photo leaves bit desired but guess you cant expect much from people who are just low budget film for heck unfair review film compare other highbudget films But alas what one must own not very good compared others still not very good But not without good points liked plot built rather nicely tied together well end Sometimes really dark scenes managed build creepy feeling well However end film fails impress characters are pretty much nonexistent dont care for any them Any them might die but possible pinpoint final survivor from very early
