looking forward Kathryn Bigelows movie with great anticipation after endless hype Oscars which awarded Unfortunately really isnt good movie depiction situation certainly seemed accurate believable all counts but beyond story simply came across incomplete direction movie appeared uncertain haphazard actors put good effort but for didnt really get what movie trying not atmospheric gripping Full Metal Jacket not epic Band Brothers not action packed aswell anything certainly cant see why nominated for much nor why people are hyping these epic proportions Mind you given calibre movies last couple years suppose theres not lot choose from
