sadly disappointed film due fact felt false characters were not strong enough carry films pretty weak attempt horror basic idea for film interesting but unfortunately wasnt able excite really scare shock there one part entire film thought gruesome but even didnt redeem did get like character Kate end film she seemed soften become little more realistic end character played Jeremy Sheffield not actually needed for film think directorwriter got carried away with myriad characters used for purpose had left basic characters making more solo effort Kates part may have worked Jeremys acting wooden say least felt uncomfortable watching bad screen chemistry lack Such shame Disappointing
