DER TODESKING not one favorite Jorg Buttgereit film but still interesting film dealing with suicide reasons ramifications Those looking for gorefest exploitation style NEKROMANTIK films SCHRAMM will probably disappointed DER TODESKING definitely arthouse style film those need linear explainable narratives need not apply basic concept DER TODESKING there episode for each day week revolves around strange chain letter apparently causes people commit suicide interspersed with scenes slowly decomposing corpse There are some very well done thought provoking scenes including man talking about problems with wife concert massacre which unfortunately lost some power because too busy laughing SCORPIONS lookalike band stage But seriously sometimes beautiful scene shows different angles huge bridge particularly effective especially you understand significance scene names shown are people actually committed suicide from jumping from bridge sometimes confusing sometimes silly SHE WOLF ripoff pretty amusing sometimes harrowing found scene guy talking girl park about wife particularly effective film more experience then just entertainment many these art films are meant Still didnt find DER TODESKING strong NEKROMANTIK SCHRAMM would probably put relatively even footing with NEKROMANTIK terms personally enjoyment level Definitely worth look any Buttgereit art film fan you dig type film check out SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY opinion BEST arthousehorror film Ive seen 710 for DER TODESKING
