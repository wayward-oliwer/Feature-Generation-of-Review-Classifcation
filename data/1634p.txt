excellent drama had suspense whole time could not take eyes off screen for one second because every word kept connecting pieces puzzling murder movie really touched because showed how sad hard life can really did cry end which dont want give away also let realize how cruel sickening people can when comes murder cast also very good only bad cast member actress who played Anne Marie actress did great job but director didnt say because found someone who didnt look single bit like Anne Marie Fahey herself
