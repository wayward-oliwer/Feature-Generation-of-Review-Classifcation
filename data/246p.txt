When started watching show said corny Elfen Lied not even bloody indeed setup almost identical with single young boy living big house all himself then suddenly getting involved into fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him But where resemblance stops love story almost subtle intense one Inuiyasha while childish remarks behaviors are very few magical setup bit corny because about seven people with seven servants fighting for Holy Grail all servants someone famous half all masters from same school rules engagement etc However soon dims fades from beauty drawing script actually watched all episodes one day without comparing with animes liked more but were from other genres have say very pleased
