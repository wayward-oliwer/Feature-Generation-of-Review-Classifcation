borrowed movie because not only because gay theme but thought role playing really intrigued pleasantly surprised shot San Francisco since live near course nice see shots Castro district although castro really caters more gay male than female But other than cant really recommend movie characters arent really developed for care when they finally started get role playing already bored out mind role playing scenes did see were bit embarrassing watch acting leaves something desired Needless say didnt finish movie skip one
