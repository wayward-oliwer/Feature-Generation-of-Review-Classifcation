not well shot well written well acted but most addictive show Ive seen since Twin Peaks Every single revelation timed well you have see next episode get any kind closure They have even slowed down pace show where they only reveal tiny amounts information per episode however feels like theyve just told you everything you wanted know However some acting just about some duologue downright brutal Some characters are very two dimensional more experienced actors like Locke Ecko really stand out over actors who play Jack Kate Sayid development show can also very frustrating following episode may not show what previous episode lead Annoying side plots have become part story sometimes tell you nothing However second season developed point where back stories reveal more about island than they had previously All all great show but not perfect
