probably one few Australians not watching tennis when series aired have say when William McInnes first appeared though one crappy actor But series continued toned down performance totally loved him such rotten guy but did make laugh watched show see Hugo Speers Heart Bones Full Monty Tom Long SeaChange Two Hands interesting see Speers play nice quiet man even more interesting watch Tom Longs rippling muscles Sigh Seriously Longs performance total shock really brilliant stole show Martin Sacks good also small role leading actress put entertaining performance recommend programme you enjoy stories with twist watching Tom Long walk around with shirt
