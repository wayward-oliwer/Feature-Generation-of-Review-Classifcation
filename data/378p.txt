Hardcastle McCormick excellent show predictable much like Dukes Hazzard Hunter ATeam etc etc etc show just good clean television relationship between Hardcastle McCormick quite amusing They often take jabs each other several times episode which adds great deal humor show contains several car chases almost every episode but who doesnt enjoy good car chase Especially with Coyote only wish they made clean television like today highly recommend
