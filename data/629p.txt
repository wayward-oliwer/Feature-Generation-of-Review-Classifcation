Theres some very clever humour film which both parody tribute actors However after while just seems exercise style notwithstanding great gags such Balasko continuing part Dussolier very good acting all involved wondering why Blier made film All revealed ending when Blier directing Claude Brasseur gets phone call from dad Bernard Blier from heaven gets chance say how much misses him effective emotional capper obviously heartfelt But there isnt really sufficient dramatic tension emotional involvement keep rest film interesting throughout entire running time Some really nice scenes sequences however anyone who likes these mosntres sacr√©s French cinema should get fair amount enjoyment out film
