What Steven Seagal thinking mean firstly love Seagal love all movies mid 2000s early stuff some best genre however does not live excellent name Attack Force with protagonist Marshall Lawson Seagal would expected mindless action movie with Seagal typical oneliner ass kicking form However what get crime mystery bordering political thriller with little action Seagal always shadows because weight could not follow story Theres people who mutate superhumans when they take drug What happened movie dubbing Seagal disgrace shambles shame Why dub man story terrible got 210 from because scene where Seagal asks for backup despite having army with him hilarious fight scene where seagal swings hands like girl facing camera Revenge two way street seagal says moviewell forget revenge Steven you need redemption
