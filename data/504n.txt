premise intriguing but sadly film just doesnt any justice casting quite good shot beautifully but stylistically much direction inconsistent overstylized fast editing been there done effect waiting for Steven Bochco run credits followed commercial characters were identified exclusively onscreen coke usage pretty much everything else left Boogie Nights for character development personable characters draw viewer into story very forgettable film
