Mouse House very classic cartoon Tom Jerry faithful their tradition but with jokes own hysterical hilarious very entertaining quite amusing Artwork good quality either short isnt just about Tom trying catch Jerry Butch lives same house trying catch mouse too because «theres only one cat house morning cat catches mouse» you ask there are lots funny gags cartoon funniest for are for example when Mammy Two Shoes sees two lazy cats sleeping says sarcastically «Im glad youre enjoying siesta» she hopes theyre satisfied because she aint making two cats gasp Another funny gag when Tom disguises himself Mammy Two Shoes slams Butch with frying pan then Butch does same trick Tom course even funnier than when real Mammy Two Shoes appears both dumb cats think they are seeing each other disguised Mammy then they both attack her rear lol Naturally she gets mad once she gets mad she isnt someone mess with But even Jerry doesnt win time because expelled her too
