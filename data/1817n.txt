hard praise film much CGI for dragon well done but lacked proper modelling for light shadow Also same footage used endlessly dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious amazed see Marcus Aurelius acting credits wondering what exEmperor Roman Empire acting film Like Whoopie Goldberg must alias can one blame him for using one appears stinker story might been interesting but acting flat direction tedious you MUST watch film around your friends house get drunk while then itll enjoyable
