usually read reviews before watch movie Guess what didnt before watching TLB have say very surprised see above average rating IMDb found have total lack story You just get dropped into sadly not way Saving Private Ryan dropped into movie also sudden end which very unsatisfying for have admit wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic especially with low budget mind But prepare yourself have laugh Some guys are tossed through air after explosion they are Olympic gymnasts midair corkscrew somersault during bit too much for especially when performed countless times during movie But parts really got laughing until almost cried were scenes containing close combat screaming shouting German voicesunbelievably funny seems they are spoken one single actor voice performer because they all sound exactly same just sounds like typical German voice would absolutely NOT recommend movie anyone except people who just want have some laughs because sad corny quality
