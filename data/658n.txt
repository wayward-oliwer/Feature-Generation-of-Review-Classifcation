supposed review for website watched with optimism perhaps would least cheesy yet entertaining rip off didnt even well enough 666 Child probably one worst supernatural thrillers Ive ever seen Even worse than Godsend with scenes rip from Omen without shame ending even very similar way Omen ends Not mention acting writing story are all just hackneyed these movies make money sad see where Asylum headed embarrassing
