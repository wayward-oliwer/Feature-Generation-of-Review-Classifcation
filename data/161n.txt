hate how movie absolutely creative input know theyre for realism but frank just dont want realism Realism boring want see daily life Ill uhm live Tell interesting story well talk can deal with low production values hell sucker for low production values but least work some good ideas direction only goes far grabbing camcorder walking around bit but obviously supposed dig because makes stuff much more realistic Hitchcock used say drama essentially life with dull bits cut out can only conclude not drama not long shot get see Rosetta walking someplace Rosetta working bakery Rosetta eating waffle Rosetta carrying around bags far Rosetta walking back home Rosetta walking someplaceits just not entertaining There isnt really deeper meaning either got bored started looking for some reflections life movie but just plain realism most overrated quality business guess supposed love but come theres nothing there
