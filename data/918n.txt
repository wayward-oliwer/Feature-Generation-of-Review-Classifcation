When first watched show first few episodes seemed promising Bill Compton introduced himself stereotypical mysterious vampire Sookie presented herself independent woman However show went downhill from here once interesting characters are entertaining cardboard box story progresses main characters lose their original personalities along with their acting abilities episode Bills furrowed eyebrows are low face just consists forehead Sookie rather actress even more dead than her vampire lover All these tragic events are surrounding her she only reacts how enjoyable losing her virginity Personally think they made main characters sleep with each other too early show way they teased each other something had hooked could easily toyed with bit more soon Sookie loses she struts around like total ditz only thinking Bills libido size appendage Bill also loses debonair attitude well just gets plain silly actions are never really explained except does for Sookie Why Their love for each other never delved into there any love far just seems sex core their relationship Yeah yeah vampires usually equal sex but come Every five seconds see some sort humping wasnt much surprise since HBO always tries pass soft core porno decent show Bill popping out dirt just getting with Sookie with reason whats ever laughed hard almost peed myself plot just stream consciousness characters never into detail about anything All events happen are usually left unexplained only thing constant sex only thing can say like are minor characters Tara her drunk mother are far more interesting than major characters only reason why continue watch show for development minor characters Minus sex main characters show would much more worthwhile
