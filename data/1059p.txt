After seeing Break Leg Vancouver release party thought very enjoyable film had few outright belly laughs some cameos Eric Roberts particular were scream havent heard word about actual release date although Ive heard close story simple but mainly vehicle for characters situations script smooth seamless plot develops effortlessly acting comfortable yet fresh film won least one award from EACH film festivals been which around highly recommend Break Leg
