Right away film ridiculous Not didnt have redeeming aspects For example best thing about film beautiful background scenery Anyone not living East Coast should know South doesnt have beautiful mountains like those found West knew Utah right off bat but perhaps Dalton couldnt suppress English accent they had excuse saying southern town Subverting accent into Southern one easier Sure film plot twists but phony sense place something couldnt get past not like Utah doesnt have meth labs why writers thought necessary pretend South beyond One other thing action pictures always puzzles Why they always make cocking sound effect when character pulls out automatic handgun seemed every other sound effect movie chukchich signifying 9mm loaded ready fire course weapons already had rounds chambered unnecessary Lastly pyrotechnics were WAY over top But hey film targeted certain market segment suppose too bad Each actors can act but film lame
