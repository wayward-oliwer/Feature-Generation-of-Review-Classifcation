gave high Why Because bloody well rocked time when there were many OTHER shows were tied toysgames show unique had overlapping stories others have said here ahead time Sadly why show doomed They have released DVDs with episodes series far hoping more come out How does compare watching now years after first came out dont know still like despite sometimes clunky animation IMHO only flaw writing almost top notch way ahead competition hope for more DVDs even set all episodes proper order DVDs are good but dont think stories are their proper order but despite show rocked
