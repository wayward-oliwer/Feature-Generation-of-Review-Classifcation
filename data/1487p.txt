Other reviewers here seem think film simply not true little unfair acting good quality direction moves with decent fluidity dont think theres anything wrong with Tarantinoesquire way interlocking stories together Perhaps just new tool for directors try thought made film much more interesting Perhaps few elements script need tightening but about only fault can find Nestor Cantillana gives great performance Sylvio also Antonella Rios stunning worth price admission alone
