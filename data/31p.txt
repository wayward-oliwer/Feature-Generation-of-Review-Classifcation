superb episode one best both seasons Down right horror for change with story way way above average MOH episodes there such thing mans wife almost burned death tragic car wreck which driving airbag worked hers didnt She burned beyond recognition great makeup btw not given much chance live without full skin graft BUT even coma she keeps dying but brought back modern technology when she does die for few minutes her ghost appears very vengeful spirit Carnage course ensues also some extremely gory killings also some extremely sexy scenes What more could you ask for you might ask Well not much because baby all very satirical ending should leave smile most viewers faces just loved Rob Schmidts Wrong Turn direction too great knack for horror Excellent episode one buying for sure
