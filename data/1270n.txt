excruciatingly slow pace film probably directors express intention order convey what life like growing village teen China However found combination glacially slow plot general filming style impersonal totally alienating particularly western audience times actually had trouble telling some characters apart they were filmed from such distance Two hours totally past caring someone who not only interested music but also very into history culture China way stranger Chinese cinema couldnt engage with single character found nothing get teeth into begs question disliked who earth would like Give Zhang Yimou give Chen Kaige Give work just about any other Chinese director Ive ever seen sorry effort just doesnt measure all sorry see Chinese cinema judged against benchmark
