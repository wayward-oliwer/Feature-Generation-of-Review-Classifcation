STAR RATING Saturday Night Friday Night Friday Morning Sunday Night Monday Morning Marshall Lawson Steven Seagal assigned France reconaissance mission along with three new young striketeam recruits after disobeying direct order from above However night before theyre due strike they are all found grusomely slaughtered killer with seemingly inhuman strength With French police dallying around with their own investigation goes search those responsible himself only uncover corrupt faction military dealing deadly new drug alters persons DNA gives them terrifying new strength Bad cover Bad title Bad postproduction tampering bad trailer Pretty bad film But Ive got say dont think Attack Force quite worst know will make unpopular with most other reviewers here perhaps not Steveday but think lot criticism stemmed from all bad news went before film rather than actual quality itself must say there nowhere near much dubbing ropey editing been lead believe dubbing there which made him sound like Martin Sheen with groin problem pretty quite frequent but not use for large segment film thought plot flowed pretty smoothly well considering all messing about with original finished film called Harvester went Also another reviewer noted film nice Gothic look new touch for Seagal film absolute killer low point though complete total lack any exciting action with only few poorly filmed fight scenes for any fun have honest though would rather watch again than Flight Fury Today You Die Out for Kill
