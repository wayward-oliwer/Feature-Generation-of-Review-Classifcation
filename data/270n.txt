first look plot tagline figured could have been decent film Could have ever been more wrong beginning film makes look like bunch freaks got together decided make low budget film For first minutes you dont notice cheesy acting horrible sound godawful special effects but then gets worse Just about minutes into asking myself What plot again could only ask question when wasnt busted out laughing from sheer lameness film main actor one setting for emotions sticks throughout entire film even though supposed through love hate everything inbetween flashback scene almost made vomit because made relive one extra minute footage from earlier movie Now hit middle film where they are obviously trying rip off Morpheus from Matrix although just horrible job actors talking about Star Wars fortune cookie phrases almost unbearable Now end movie you dont realize end movie because you actually think plot finally developing Morpheus character dies ONLY good thing about movie utters couple words credits roll What plot bad acting cheesy everything couldnt get any worse Please you value human decency NOT WATCH MOVIE
