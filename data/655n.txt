Never saw original movie seriesI only hope much better movie than sequel made 1980s not how were these two terrible sequels even justified movie had really good lead when they were advertising shown one those old independent stations are thing past now Anyways looked like would pretty good scary movie however movie would make some Walt Disney movies look dark Really movie just bunch light fluff with virtually boggy creek creature seen only real sighting near end when you see shape during very heavy rainstorm other than there virtually sign creature which really disappointing kid story basically old evil hunters must kill anything they see are after boggy creek creature kids are out help just some random hairy guy woods likes pull random boats through water Not really worth watching would however like see original granted maker would make also bad boggy creature but also made very good slasher movie Town Dreaded Sundown
