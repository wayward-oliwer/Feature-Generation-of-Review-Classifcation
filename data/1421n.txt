Comeback starts off looking promising with brutal death scene mask wearing killer mask itself pretty cool too looks almost identical one used 1990s slasher film Granny From then film mostly boring get few more deaths which again are good but theres not enough them reason deaths are good because they are frenzied bloody story behind film actually rather interesting would have worked very well had not been boring for most part would avoid unless youre diehard collector theres not enough here even make average slasher flick
