wasnt sure how rate movie since bad actually very funny not Gackt fan any means though talented despite weird pseudonym sounds like cat coughing hairball always thought Hyde talented though Faith interesting album But topic here folks movie ridiculous over top nonsensical almost like parody supernatural action films movie almost plot here except just about vampires with gangster friends way film almost reminded SpiderMan with how there were too many ideas which resulted not enough time pay attention one them action scenes were laughable Quickly edited almost hard understand with choreography laughably bad Though Hyde looked very stylish during action scenes but films only such redemption sucker for good action movies but action horribly done Though final shootout highlight otherwise depressing movie keeps jumping between genres not good thing wants drama action flick horror romance what hell review making you mad why because Gackt Hyde are your love Dont fool yourself MOVIE BAD
