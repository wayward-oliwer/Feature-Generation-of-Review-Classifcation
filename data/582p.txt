Well against grain film seems self confessed horror fan sat down not quite knowing what expect After mins actually found myself scared quite rare film obviously small budget set around charing cross station but films lack money does not distract from story story bit far fetched doesnt explain itself very well but CREEP class act proceeds slash dismember anything comes way MESSAGE FOR LADIES THERE ARE CERTAIN PARTS FILM YOU SHOULD CLOSE YOUR EYES LEAST CROSS YOUR LEGS you will understand when you see All all good film makes change see good slasher movie actually scares
