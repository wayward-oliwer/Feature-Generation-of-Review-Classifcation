After seeing MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS still convinced first decent movie about teenage witches yet made didnt think much CRAFT not into CHARMED either only film more less enjoyed about teenage witches LITTLE WITCHES 1996 even one wasnt very good But changes are you liked all aforementioned movies you will also enjoy MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS expecting silly cheesy early movie about teenage witches high school But rather surprised whole movie plays rather serious acting decent serious all time jokes are played teenagers something musical score first thought pretty good some scariness also something classy with use threatening violins all But movie progressed came conclusion score just too ambitious They didnt have add those threatening violins when you simply see someone back car then drive away normal speed Then theres Melissa Sue Anderson who main reason for see movie few weeks ago saw her HAPPY BIRTHDAY rather enjoyable thickplotted goofy some occasions slashermovie which she had done same year MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS must say she very good icycold bad witch Vivian But main problem with movie almost nothing happens Vivian causes death accident but Then theres Robin good witch who just learning about her powers expect two them using their powers more than once but only one occasion they use their powers make some pieces wood other stuff fly through air projectiles supposed fight between two powerful witches whats worse hoping see spectacular showdown between witches end movie with least some special effects flaming eyes whatever but nothing happens There sort confrontation end but big disappointment acting two witches good musical score decent even though overly ambitious cinematography rather dark moody times But doesnt make good movie yet does
