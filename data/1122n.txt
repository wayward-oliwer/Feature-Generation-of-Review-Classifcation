thought great idea but boy poorly executed get broad sense how complex challenging backstage operations show are but virtually specifics about any works producers dont seem have found any way tell story give viewer throughline Which not say they didnt try but having stagehands relate synopsis Ring cycle programs narrative does nothing tell about job physically mounting opera see lots things happening but are told little about what people are why Theres little sense who who how various production departments fit work together For instance several times hear about problem some sort one expects then see problem consequences andor how gets resolved But instead filmmakers generally just cut something else generally pretty generic footage people pushing stuff talking into headsets Overall film ends feeling more like pastiche images youd see run under closing credits show rather than anything worth watching for own merit
