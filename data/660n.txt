There are just many things wrong with movie begin with first twenty minutes film could have been compressed into just five maybe ten overall movie mercifully short already but could have been made for giving little more attention Mean Lion how did miss reference Wiz one working subplot little more closely into main plot short script had seed good idea but needed quite bit reworking Second could have done without crude humor original also had some could have done without but least there almost afterthought here flatulence urination abound Third show little too selfaware original series had well enough did first movie but here just way way too much Brendan Fraser injokes were just bit over top why mention new Ursula Other gags with Narrator especially couple interactions near end also exceed good sense Fourth bit more attention could have been given CGI work first hard tell Shemp wasnt real elephant except behavior course but here CGI stands out like sore thumb Ideally special effects should merely tell story whether theyre good bad they least succeed count relatively small problem but still there All said Christopher Showermans performance George decent enough lacks Brendan Frasers charm but Christopher only really fails specific comparison even managed give George bit personal depth which should have been major foul Jay Wardinspired movie but wasnt here Julie Benz new Ursula surprised even better than Leslie Mann original Most other performances were pretty standard not standing out mind either good bad
