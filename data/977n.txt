Soon after watching film you will realize why didnt even make theaters movie does not deserve prequel tag Instead common theme Hollywood rip off previously good movies with disastrous prequels sequels etc films plot bouncing all over place like ping pong ball character development nonexistent seriously felt like watching comedy some points movie because acting bad Diddy needs stop tainting movies with horrible acting actually made laugh every time only good thing comes out movie Jaclyn DeSantis who looks excellent movie actually brought some enjoyment from watching film you are big Carlitos Way fan recommend you not watch you decide watch anyway then treat movie ripped off original because exactly what did
