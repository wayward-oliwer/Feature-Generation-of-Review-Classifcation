saw movie while under limited release mainly for novelty seeing Pierce Brosnan with moustache but turned out one funniest movies have seen all year starts out almost thriller but steadily progresses into hilarious piece work full oneliners great comedic energy between Pierce Brosnan Greg Kinnear Also while say movie comedy doesnt forget heart times can very touching when needs When went into theater didnt know what expect much more than moustache but what got one best movies have seen long time Leaving theater felt very fulfilled from film plan see again wide release recommend anyone who appreciates good comedy with wellwritten script big moustache
