problem with portraying real life individual performance can good but still not work audience doesnt believe actor portraying person main issue with Young Lincoln Henry Fonda gives terrific performance but found hard believe Abraham Lincoln softspoken Fonda portrays him essentially courtroom drama with young Abraham Licoln forefront Whether not true story dont know but isnt then why tell using Lincoln central character Never mind though film Lincoln defending two young men who are accused murder Theres really not much film result seems rather empty wanted more story character development film 100 minutes long but doesnt feel like There are some little scenes featuring Lincoln blooming relationship with Mary Todd but they seem superficial acting good all around but said Fondas performance works character but not Abraham Lincoln just dont believe real Lincoln softspoken True big voice when needs such when persuades drunken lynch mob let accused stand trial but Fonda portrays Lincoln too meekly other performances are solid though especially Alice Brady Abigail Clay mother accused Shes nice lady who can really feel for Simple uneducated yet very sweet can see why Lincoln wanted help her John Ford seems think film epic time release probably But even then theres just not enough material present such nice watch but not classic
