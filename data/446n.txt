Lame cliched superhero action movie drivel had high hopes for movie genre buddy cop actioneers one dont despise but very rarely see storyline trite ludicrous one would have been forgivable always these kinds movies when action compensates unfortunately did not action does carry trademark surreality over top nature action but not very involving obscenely gory fact often completely incoherent perhaps due reediting for american release does show signs many places patchwork very disappointed
