caught movie SciFi before heading into work youve any interest seeing Dean Cain dive avoid enveloped flames least dozen times movie for you doesnt peak your interest well afraid youll wish YOU were one about enveloped flames because movie pretty bad acting begin with characters are all completely obnoxious dialogue worse than your typical Zgrade SciFi movie Towards end movie began remind Hollow Man complete with escape via elevator shaft except with Dragon not naked invisible man Unlike other similar flicks however one wasnt even awesomely badit just plain bad
