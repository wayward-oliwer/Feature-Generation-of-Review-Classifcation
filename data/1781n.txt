can only believe Garson Kanin must have been two people one who wrote brilliant Double Life funny Born Yesterday cowrote such excellent screenplays Adams Rib Pat Mike with wife Ruth Gordon then one who wrote andor directed such tiresome sad drivel Bachelor Mother Some Kind Nut cast tries but script tired clich√©d even efforts always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated script sinks nadir truly offensive sequence which Janssens character tests Drivass character make sure not gay ugly sequence but sadly one which could easily play film today Ethnic jokes are now totally verboten but fag jokes are still good clean family fun
