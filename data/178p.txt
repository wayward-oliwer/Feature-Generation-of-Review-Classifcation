Sarah Silverman program very similar Sarahs own stand over top with prejudice you cant possibly take heart fact though while most all people will get doesnt mean they will all appreciate very polarizing one dimensional show you dont like after minutes you may well give there you like after minutes stay tuned because every episode thus far been good last Like all shows though not perfect Personally love program but there are some huge faults with Racist songs are funny but get older lot faster than Silverman seems realizea problem had with Jesus Magic well seems Silverman gave herself quota for songs per episode doesnt need exist Not mention while lyrics songs she writes are good music well isnt Another thing keep mind while show will for some reason appeal fans Monty Python Upright Citizens Brigade etc nothing like those shows can watch Monty Python all day but much like show cant watch more than half hour limit time gets flat very fast repeat value for show low toothe second time around episode fairly funny third time opinion boring Still first time around very very funny Give shot
