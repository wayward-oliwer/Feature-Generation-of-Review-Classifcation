film absolutely stunning new Blade Runner future noir most gritty vision Paris superb both recognisable visionary with sweeping vistas grungy set pieces futuristic virtual reality story line quite simple with few surprises but not what like most about film visual treat Done rendered black white greys with only one short spot colour less hard eyes than sounds There are many arty camera shots closeups odd viewpoints but just adds temperament film Overall you get impression graphic novel footage form initially under impression film had been rotoscoped such level animation high detail characters facial expressions But unlike Scanner Darkly which suffers from indeed enhanced inconsistent character definition just watch way some hair changes shape Renaissance consistent precise throughout When character closeup details texture can bee seen but when midshot further away details are omitted but not detriment character definition For only down side film one commentary are told oneoff project Such shame would like see more futuristic filmnoir storyline especially cuttingedge graphic style English dub great too All all great film highly recommended
