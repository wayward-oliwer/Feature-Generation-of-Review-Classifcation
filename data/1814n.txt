Ive seen all four movies series Each one strays further further from books worst one yet problem does not follow book titled after any way directors producers should have named any thing other than Loves Abiding Joy only thing about movie remotely resembles book are names some characters Willie Missie Henry Clark Scottie Cookie namesagesgenders children are wrong entire story line where book find great disservice Janette Oke her books her fans produce movie under her title not correct any way music too loud actors are not convincing they lack emotions you want good family movie might clean Dont watch though you are hoping for condensed version book hope will last movie from series but doubt there are more movies made wish Michael Landon others would stick closer original plot story lines books are excellent closely followed would make excellent movies
