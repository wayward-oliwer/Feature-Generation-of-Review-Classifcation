warned movie tells lots love stories without any coherence only intention movie seems showing love many different ways Each story only few minutes there development characters nearly plot Just sketchy idea plot writer tried build turning points aimed surprise viewer However just didnt work out because you didnt get know characters before these jokes were just silly movie about love fails reach your heart dozen times even more dont know dont care
