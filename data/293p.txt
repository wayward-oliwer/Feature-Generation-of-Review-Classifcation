had fun watching Red Eye not masterpiece but well directed structured Cillian Murphy Rachel McAdams are perfect role same old story with different setting but Craven gave good pace least not another Scream with usual college killer nice when you can see clean coherent thriller even when originality doesnt stand out main character Particularly from filmmaker like Craven brought many innovative ideas thriller horror genre past now just lends himself bringing home what could have been good movie had not been released theatrically Good job
