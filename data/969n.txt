generally LIKE watching Burt Lancasters filmsespecially when needed nuts with imposing screen presence like Elmer Gantry However greatest strength magnetism occasionally also greatest weakness rarely ever underplayed ANYTHING lack subtlety really hinders Rainmaker Now understand character meant sort showman but how Katherine Hepburn could fall under spell completely inexplicable She supposed smart but doesnt seem when Lancasters blarney thrown about screen addition story perhaps one most stagy looking films have ever seen way too obvious movie based play just looks like mostly filmed sound stage instead great wide open West like supposed Overall very overrated film
