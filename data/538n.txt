Boy movie had fooled honestly thought would campy horror film with absolutely humor whatsoever boy got cold shoulder time movie truthful pretty damn good not scary all but campiness sly humor really mad movie interesting Some horrible acting clich√© killings were painful watch almost laughed how bad but some extent enjoyed killings all vaguely relate snow sports Christmas which made things more intriguing POV camera angles were awesome movie about viscous killer who dies car accident collision with chemical truck while transported prison later resurrected very same chemical with snow spliced into mixture These were ingredients chosen make perfect killer snowman than takes revenge snowman police officer who convicted him movie had such bad acting with exception Christopher Allport funny will say also pretty disappointed movie not horror but fact dark sitcom They had great story with good plot but wasnt executed right All all like movie first but now really annoying But movie way better darker than sequel
