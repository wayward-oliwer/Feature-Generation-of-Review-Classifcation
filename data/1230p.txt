loved movie all could not break down into tears while watching but really very uplifting struck performance Ray Liotta but especially talent Tom Hulce portraying Rays twin brother who mentally slow due tragic terrible childhood event But Toms character though heartbreaking knows self pity full hope life great movie dont miss
