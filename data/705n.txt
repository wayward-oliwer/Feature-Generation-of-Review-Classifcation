Tobe Hooper quite possibly biggest fluke horror genre offer Like any other horror fan loved Texas Chainsaw but think order put your name front movie title you should have least more than one hit movie cant really think any other movie Hooper done own dont count Poltergeist really made impact horror genre film world movie Night Terrors just backs point Poor Robert Englund give him credit for least good job with material given did what could for movie itself Pure drudge Unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes story must have been penned our really just scenery music cinematography Nothing film redeemable Dont waste your time Overall out feel sorry for Hooper career seems like over before really ever got started hope able pump out least one more good flick way can cult status some justice
