might bit harsh for saying but sadly far directing career true Just have look what done far They barely make past star mark Why did watch movie reasons Lucy Lawless Heroes star Greg Grunberg Lucy outstanding movie her performance carries whole movie hope she gets blockbuster breaks into bigger league actors she clearly skills Greg not impressive typical acting style movie oddly categorized horror only horror short flashbacks they last max seconds with little blood them personally would call more dramathriller But matter how interesting story actually bad directing editing acting appart from Lucy destroys You get real connection actors something which very important story like one You just sit there watching feeling nothing like watching bad soapactually think soap would more interesting advice Stay away from movieor better yet just stay away from anything Michael Hurst involved with
