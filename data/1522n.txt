Heavyhanded moralism Writers using characters mouthpieces speak for themselves Predictable plodding plot points say five times fast childs imitation Britney Spears film all earmarks Lifetime Special reject honestly believe Jesus Nebot Julia Montejo set out create thoughtprovoking emotional film tough subject exploring idea things are not always black white one who criminal definition not necessarily bad human there can extenuating circumstances especially when one puts wellbeing child first However their earnestness ends channeled into preachy dialogue trite situations planted move plot along decent production values interesting use documentarystyle camera footage are not enough accomplish their aim when script acting fall flat Logic often compromised for sake creating tension Soid first tries blackmail Pablo into participating her documentary exchange for helping them escape then same breath basically tells him not trust her because shes not helping them out altruism Well duh for man run Pablo far too swayed temper tantrum Cristinas wellbeing important him fleeing capture jail deportation for her but willing risk all appease her when she doesnt want Mexico Right Talk above overpermissive parenting Third when Pablos employer Charlie gives phone Detective Bright she remarkably unprofessional especially given her seniority did she really think she persuasive yeah would have turned myself CCH Pounders Detective Wims could wipe floor with her fair like list things liked liked midget liked fact midget named Sexy Theres crossdressing always plus juvenile crossdressing less Harry infinitely cuter than Cristina But favorite moment film when Cristina kicks Detective NotSoBright also find interesting heavily minority cast which much appreciate way black character racist one Too bad just thrown out there not further explored Theres distinctive unconventional score but nonetheless generally contextunspecific not enhancing mood tension any scene except pathetic anguished wailing every time main character anguish though they think acting doesnt show enough Just case you werent sure upset have musical cues prove Stilted clich√©d dialogue results depressing lack subtext everything spelled out dialogue even when body language had been til then conveying just fine For example every impassioned speech Pablo makes Knights lament her child wont crawling into bed with them morning Papi tell about Mama again what shameless blatant exposition introducing generic dead wife Shes always most beautiful woman widower had ever seen kindest had ever met Why cant see man cry over woman like Shakespeares she may fat ugly obnoxious but love for her deep oceans Now theres story which would move police always literally one step behind them gives many scenes outofplace feeling French farce Most boring foot chases ever Bright Lightning are outofshape easilyfooled certainly isnt quick lightning she well dont feel need spell things out Some guy dragging along small child outrunning bicycle cop complete with macho biker picking fight but then felled child quote Margaret Cho sad Would ever see Cops Hackneyed overthetop deus machina employer would you really waive checking green card just because can quote author inspirational saying poster behind your desk Plus several scenes including above threaten devolve into porn Well Ill favor for you long you something for can almost hear bowmchickabowmbowm When parents view footage shot Pablos remorse grieving moms freakout most real movie feels Unfortunately diminished fact she looks completely swayed emotional speech right until she goes ballistic more ambivalent look would more convincing here constant awe stupidity main character things for sake plot holding convenience store without mask visiting dead girls grave why doesnt mother recognize face from when she saw him before drove off You seem familiar What purpose wholly unnecessary somewhat gratuitous scene with Soid artificiallyenhanced bartender Character development Tch Too little too late Speaking unnecessary traits never went anywhere Detective Lightnings saying skeptical Detective Bright must Scorpio shows how little really knows about occult dont think believing fate quite qualifies voodoo mumbo jumbo end when Bright holds Pablo dies wait why does she care now Her character inconsistent Soids What she shoot him just because she said Stop Ill shoot Shes cared somuch about her integrity thus far unarmed There need for lethal force Whats wrong with shooting him leg immobilize him Finally Cristinas childlike acceptance her mothers death giving Knight peace over daughters death forced contrivance family whose child killed becoming Cristinas new family angers she could replacement for their little girl also unrealistic white couple would take Latino daughter man who killed their own daughter not saying there arent generous loving people who would just saying characters here are never developed far enough for believe they would find offensive another IMDb reviewer said course woman she moved sappy scenes woman who reserves emotional movements for moments dont wax sentimental manufactured manner Cowriter codirector costar Nebot said himself wore too many hats during production Too many cooks may spoil broth but one cook alone just might end making afterschool special conclusion films title less with story more with feeling regret helplessness loss accompanying revelation you will never see your money again
