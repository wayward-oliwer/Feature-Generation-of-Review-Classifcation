liked initial premise film which what led hunt out but problem quickly found one pretty much knows whats happen within first 2030 minutes doubles will come from behind mirror take over everybody There real twist which fine but final reveal doesnt make great deal sense either how can she racked with uncertainty fear for whole film shes evil from beyond mirror Admittedly scenes beyond mirror were chilling when they first appeared blondes murder also effectively creepy but ultimately alas seems film search story more engaging script piling atmosphere upon atmosphere over top scary sound design for 8090 minutes does not really cut fact gets quite dull
