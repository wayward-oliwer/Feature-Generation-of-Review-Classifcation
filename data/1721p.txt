liked movie because basically did more with less could have been made more interesting they had kept confined studio even more though some plot elements would have been harder develop guy playing did good job showing someone spooked out haunted memories also found dialog with callers pretty funny While parts movie you can see coming mile away other parts you not expect turn out way they did thought pretty minimal ghost story for most part concentrating more living side equation last 510 minutes were pretty well done everything revealed While shorter movie felt just about right amount time tell story Any more would have started drag
