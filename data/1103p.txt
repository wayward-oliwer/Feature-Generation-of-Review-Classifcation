Call adolescent but really think great series you havent had chance experience few episodes latest Star Trek series you should definitely watch one Perhaps more compelling than Voyagers Caretaker which launched series with Cpt Janeway Archers adventures are completely different yet strangely familiarThe music catchy too true Scifi fan can without seeing least one Star Trek episodeand these installments make wait worthwhile
