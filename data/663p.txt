When went watch movie expectations were really low but pleasantly surprised thought watch boring teenflick BUT fact plot interesting well executed acting somewhat convincing especially from Melville who really shows talent movie fight scenes were for low budget movie very well done think movie deserves broader audience than received movie which can seen whole family maybe not smallest kids since contains some rather rough scenes movie about love problems can occur when you against your family traditions movie very much like Bend like Beckham but actually think movie pulls off better
