What can say hasnt been said about Haunting everything would make great picture Wonderful sets moody music sound design die for were all place screenplay though sometimes boggles mind such weird surrealistic way entire team must have forgotten read through maybe because they were too busy creating effects building gothic sets notice how weak plot Each member cast gives worthy performance although with little conviction material hand Lili Taylor most while others mostly react her But about All can say slightly enjoyable two hours but you will definitely want more lot more
