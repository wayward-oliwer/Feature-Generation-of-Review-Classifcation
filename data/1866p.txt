Father Pride another those good shows unfortunately dont have very long life pretty sad specially you consider almost all time worst shows are still air think Simple life admit are many similarities with show Simpsons but despite similarities show have own merits animation just adequate not incredible but good best are characters All animals are very likable funny even Sigfried Roy had their moments music good liked many songs Even show isnt very original think had lots potential Like Mission Hill show isnt very famous but liked lot didnt have appreciation deserved What shame
