not sure quite why clicked contains spoiler because quite honestly there not enough explanation ever given movie know enough what supposed spoil Visually mostly delivers Well apart from some throwback rubbermask monsters Ill say now before watching had never seen band Lordi nor knew anything about them bar they won Eurovision Apparently monsters are members band pretty much their stage personas Whatever Anyway didnt know while watching just thought monstersdemons were mostly passable Just about almost sure there semicoherent explanation behind what see onscreen but may actually better not know probably would actually have been incredibly lame come think action keeps rolling along pretty much well enough keep viewer mostly entertained even half entertainment factor joking about wtf supposed happening movie exactly gave four mainly because got good laugh out especially out how explains pretty much nothing Must have been mood but found hella funny for some reason Then look movie internet find out NOBODY knows what hell supposed about amused further raised score extra half point 410 not scary particularly coherent but pretty nice visually sonically Overall far from essential but watchable Dont expect too much dont expect make any sense might entertain you you are right mood
