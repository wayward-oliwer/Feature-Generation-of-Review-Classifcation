Look theres nothing spectacularly offensive about film just boring typical romcom with ending you can see coming before youve seen much trailer key difference classic romcoms tackle their stories with wit lack pretension movie pretension but really sense movement you feel though you could get walk away any moment production movie also feel debut movie made about fifteen years ago recommend rewatching classic movie like When Harry Met Sally instead shallow imitation one other BIG problemno chemistry youre used seeing Michael looking all cute Vaughn Alias youre seriously disappointed with way theyve made him look here
