Mind friends saw movie based off title alone cute though obvious plot direction you know where movie within first five minutes main contention with plot while remains tolerably consistent they never explain lot things behind characters alcoholic father overworked mother stressedout sister bad family but aside from occasional mention from sister theres not any resolution also confused scene with bottles seemed pretty random writing secondary concern kids werent bad actors but their script left lot desired Unfortunately what could have been cute niche movie pushed aside for single blah special effect lame scripting glaringly obvious plot
