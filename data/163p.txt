movie little unusual got very slim plot movie itself done very slow leisurely pace While makes pretty different from average Grant film still highly watchable entertaining sort like someone said lets just follow Cary around watch gets perturbed all little problems come when you are having house rehabbed Considering what fun actor film great support gets from Myrna Loy Melvin Douglas film works very well While film pretty modest pretensions makes most material great film for Cary Grant fans for whole family
