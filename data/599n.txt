Really amazing pile pap predictable slow moving soul destroying mind numbing movie which slitting your own wrists with rusty bread knife seems well almost necessary acting over done for thin dialogue every scene least twice long needs intricate details how career collapsing career rising just far too dreary mundane for words music would good you didnt have sit through movie but really three good songs not enough reward for effort required watch movie Watching film prayed God for narcolepsy for someone shoot Never ever ever again
