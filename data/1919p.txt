dont know whether recommend movie fans Tetsuo not Why Tetsuo Because you can easily label some things about movie very obvious Tetsuo rip off concept similar editing equally frantic fast which good because aside from making movie more dynamic obscures some flaws caused low budget other factors There lot more gore less eroticism case Meatball machine transformation human into creature partially machine sounds familiar called Necroborg very original caused slimy little aliens These slimy little scums from outer space actually use human vessels for their gladiator games they play with each other They infest body somehow manage put insane amount mechanical parts pulling them seemingly out nowhere turn into killing machine targets other Necroborgs Their aim defeat another alien who another Necroborg rip out corpse eat All all plot sounds somewhat silly didnt expect much but end actually enjoyed film said before low budget flick but still relatively decent Dont expect much from actors theyre mostly not very good but can tolerated liked atmosphere gore certain bizarre situations way movie directed edited Although story not too original possesses certain charm least out
