Pokémon fan enjoyed movie very much introduces new legendary Pokémon each movie does adds depth relationships between characters however not expect those who are not Pokémon fans enjoy itThis includes MOST adults Some lines were corny but can somewhat unavoidable when dubbing movie over English animation beautiful although there were couple parts did not look good although villain kind corny think movies have done good job cycling through different types villains guarantee you they arent all like one Those who did not like say each own but Pokémon fans will love
