film something like sequel White Zombie since made same man Halperin features zombies Halperin George Romero day fails deliver with one though have man who can control minds people Cambodia search destroy source power zombies can sent free Also love interest for evil man Where film really excels imagery Cambodian temples dancers are very nice zombie look very powerful their large numbers Unfortunately dont really get see much zombies action love story seems play much too large role for horror film though valid plot reason later would have loved see some 1930s zombies attack helpless city folk but film just did not deliver strong villain like Bela Lugosi waiting battle against our heroes use Lugosis eyes nice effect but misleading never film why not recreate with new actors eyes Overall film could great one with little script reworking could someday powerful remake especially they keep same postwar time frame Heck they can fix Hills Have Eyes then film hope
