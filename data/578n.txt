Needless remake cant come close capturing charm original extreme length causes more than few yawn inducing parts version ridiculously politically correct film lacks style mostly lacks talent not just with acting but direction sets costumes etc are all below par blatant disregard for period detail Vanessa Williams only cast member shows any flair Tyne Daly isnt too bad They should have left well enough alone singing ranges good Vanessa Williams poor everyone else Watch original 1963 version skip one There not much here recommend
