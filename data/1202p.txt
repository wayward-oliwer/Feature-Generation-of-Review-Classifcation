best Cheech Chong movie far all Cheech Chong most certain best far think Ive seen them all about twelve times least love them all But most definitely best Compared with others one covers lot themes gives you lot good laughs Part texts are still part our language today after years hope one day they can make another one because they still are great comedians heard they are writing new script who knows guess these guys are only ones who succeeded making decent movies genre wonder John Ashcroft ever watched one them
