went see Fever Pitch with Mom can say both loved wasnt typical romantic comedy where someone pining for other blah blah blah You werent waiting for climatic first kiss for them finally get together more real because you saw them through relationship rather than whole movie about them getting together People could actually relate film because didnt seem like extraordinary circumstances impossible situations really funny think Jimmy Fallons best performance All all would definitely recommend
