overrated just bit offset least one those grumpy reviews But did enjoy didnt laugh out loud but held interest pulled along without dropping any point story built Yeah you knew would have happy endingthis genre always does Meantime quirky with sight gags you could miss pay attention when you watch Stiller Black delivered expertly yet again Good team They should work together more Dont know will cult classic but certainly fun ride Not good WHAT ABOUT BOB DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS but what still worth out your way little get watch movie
