movie disappointing incomplete dull While Alec Baldwin tried portray himself Perfect fair just prosecutor not mention executive producer movie never showed any defense counsels tried challenge audience with actual meaningful debate subject how country could led down such terrible path Sure nobody wants defend Nazis point view but POINT Nuremberg Trails Four hours simply bashing Nazis cmon been done already really think Alec Baldwin should just stick Kim Bassingers husband Right after movie ended TNT showed 1959 movie Trail Nuremberg movie FAR superior
