first exposure Whale Music Rheostatics album same name bought around 1993 reading liner notes band said album which remains prominent place collection inspired Canadian author Paul Quarringtons book picked book few months later devoured amazing read have since reread book numerous times each time finding some new element Desmond desire complete Whale Music found film 1996 video havent had lot good experiences with Canadian film but one worked for role Claire could have been cast differently but overall think Paul Quarringtons vision transfered nicely from book screen Maury Chaykin gives moving performance isolated genius movie deals with family relationships love finding someone who understands would strongly recommend Whale Music not only music fans but anyone who ever lost something someone tried find their way back world
