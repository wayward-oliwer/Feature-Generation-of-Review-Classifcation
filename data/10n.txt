huge disappointment from writer Hamm director Dante Their previous collaboration first seasons Homecoming twisted darkly hilarious all right ways poor handling intriguing premise left bewildered supposed payoff showing generic aliens extracting something from brains infected psychopaths completely unsatisfying explained nothing point story extraterrestrial cleaning planet human infestation why did they about such gratuitously sadistic misogynistic fashion Why not just unleash completely lethal virus Stephen Kings Stand instead having male population butcher females kept hoping episode would improve kept watching but just got more pretentious preposterous religious subtext simply seemed forced but clear Sam Hamm must have thought profound weight gave like lot both Dante Hamms work but just unwatchable
