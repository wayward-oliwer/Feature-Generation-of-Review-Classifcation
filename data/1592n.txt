have only had luxury seeing movie once when rather young much movie blurred trying remember However can say not funny movie called killer tomatoes should have been most memorable things from movie are song scene with elderly couple talking about poor Timmy Other than movie really just scenes little tomatoes big tomatoes rolling around people acting scared overacting people should movie type However just having very silly premise catchy theme song not good comedy make Granted movie supposed movie nothing taken seriously however you should still make jokes are funny not try extend mildly amusing premise into full fledged movie Perhaps short would have been fine trailer showing elderly couple mentioned above man desperately trying gun down larger tomato actually pretty good trailer itself looked like mock trailer but they indeed made full movie rather weak one
