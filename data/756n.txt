from movie There are many things wrong with film acting writing direction editing etc amazing something rises top proves itself absolute worst music noted film two composers listed must reason why every single frame music absolute worst movie style drivel They have never heard expression less more got painful listen muted sound every time there dialogue not dialogue good You have feel sorry for Robert Wagner Tom Bosley sure they didnt see roles like twilight their careers See your own risk
