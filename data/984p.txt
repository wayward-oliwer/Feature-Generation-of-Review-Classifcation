Murder Mesopotamia have always considered one better Poirot books very creepy ingenious ending There doubt adaptation visually striking with some lovely photography very haunting music score always David Suchet impeccable Hercule Poirot comedic highlight episode Poirots battle with mosquito middle night Hugh Fraser good rather naive Captain Hastings remainder cast turn decent performances but are careful not overshadow two leads danger some Christie adaptations Some episode quite creepy juxtaposition episode tragic Five Little Pigs episode enjoyed lot more than one What made creepy particular putting aside music when Louise Leidner sees ghostly face through window About adaptation fairly faithful book but will say there were three things didnt like main problem pacing rather slow there are some scenes where very little happens didnt like fact also they made Joseph Mercado murderer book see him rather nervous character but intervention idea making him murderer underdeveloping made him less appealing character though glad they didnt miss drug addiction also noticed writers left out fact Mercado book falls into hysteria when she believes she murderers next victim other thing wasnt impressive felt may have been more effective adaptation had been viewpoint Amy Leatheran like book Amy somehow seemed less sensitive adaptation whole despite some misjudgements writers behalf liked Murder Mesopotamia 710 Bethany Cox
