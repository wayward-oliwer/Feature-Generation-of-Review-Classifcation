Man must say when saw trailer excited Futuristic soldiers taking bad ass Vampires led genre vet Michael IronsideIn Space mean wasnt expecting high art but looked like potential movie classic doubt pilot reedited some time later into feature film after wasnt picked Alright Ill start with films few good points action competent for lower budgeted film CGI locations used were passable Now onto bad first off Michael Ironside barley performance herewell cheesy not good way But said wasnt much anyways cant blame him One thing really stupid PETA type group for Vampires not joking dumbest most unbelievable thing Ive seen along time taken seriously Also film commits one major movie sins teases lesbian scene doesnt deliver Most all what sinks film nothing really happens Since meant pilot script almost nonexistent doesnt have regular ending Even main villains only come towards end ever movie needed Sleaze gore factor Vampire Wars closing will say main crew spaceship were all very capable actors could very well put mess behind them bigger better things They just had nothing work with here
