one worst movies ive ever encountered but want say some criticisms had heard turned out unwarranted far pure filmmaking technique goes director competent held back limited budget camera but actual editing camera angles camera movements scene staging are pretty professional ive seen many movies where directing much worse least scenes flow way not confusing few clever shots here there Also forest scenes contained decent atmosphere There only much you can with camera does nice job far technicalities far artistic merit there none scene where camera pans down can watch guy urinate woods for seconds sort epitomizes artistic style whole film pure trash Total garbage gore decent for film budget range obviously fake but theres lots very outlandish saw American version with intentionally campy dubbing good idea only thing allowed make through film Unfortunately overdone especially towards end really terrible film but have recommend for camp value really hard find movie worse than sort puts unique category
