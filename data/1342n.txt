Well probably about lambasted everyone site but Good Earth one worst structured films Ive seen long time have half hour film feels like three half because two films one first film tells story family move form their home because drought famine They have travel south cities find food work some kind Conveniently they happen find bag jewels same time they find out drought ended Yeah With knowledge they return home with their riches everything fine wonderful again Well takes about hour half film while incredibly lifeless point does have nice arc You would think would fantastic place end film However film then continues for whole other hour remaining time takes simple story about family dealing with hardships world turns into sappy melodrama about betrayal jealousy between lovers yea age old money root all evil blah blah blah Just because you know your making epic film doesnt mean your story can needlessly for more than Also main idea would gather about film earth good family holds them together Then why spend hour telling story about rich man falling love with another woman why final moment film dedicated wife our main character hasnt even cared about through most film wait film isnt only thing poorly written main characters wife makes absolutely sense She complains lot about how she slave she never wants have slave yadda yadda yadda Then why drop hat she willing sell her only daughter into slavery Even they are starving time idea still doesnt make sense when minutes later film she complaining about not wanting slave again There are other films from thirties should paid attention only thing one for cinematography land shot beautifully sequence with locusts quite impressive Too bad were film had nothing say One last thing know point time Hollywood focused mostly stars they figured good actor can portray anything For most film Paul Muni does portray Asian man best ability but once hits half point where film goes for reason loses just becomes regular old Italian Paul they even cut hair looks like Tony from Scarfacealso better film than all main characters film think maybe three are actually Asian rest are just Americans silly please Rainer really nice one note performance not could rip Oscar out your hands would Good Earth one epic waste time you want something along vain watch nice evening get Grapes Wrath film truly deserves all praise gets Mainly because wasnt written monkey
