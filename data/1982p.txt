Both friend thought movie well done expected light hearted comedy but got full blown action movie with comic thrusts both thought movie may have not done well box office previews lead believe comedy impressed with supporting actors course Dave Morse always puts terrific acting job Most supporting cast are veterans not first timers they were solid both felt writing direction were first rate made comments each other about buying movie you dont buy rent for good time
