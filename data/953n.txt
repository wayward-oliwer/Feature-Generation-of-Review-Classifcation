There really good movie lurking just beneath surface layers upon layers cheese Pagemaster found out when watched again morning after neglecting for years years remember hating with passion when first came out but time found special effects are quite good plot just Neverending Story with creativityendectomy but okay little flick for anyone who just wants some really awesome eyecandy animation amazing especially liked how animators let their characters look act bit more surrealistic than norm giving grade three would have given two just for parody value had ever decided watch movie expecting absolutely blow mind storywise
