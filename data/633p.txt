must say movie truly amazing heartwarming Reese Witherspoon charming Jason Londons not bad either sweet watching Dani fall love breaks heart yet warms heart same time watching Court fall love with Maureen however even sweeter watching how much cares for Dani must admit though did kind want him fall for Dani end just cute watching her fall for him did not want her get her heart broken badly but biggest tragedy have ever seen occurred movie watching him die made cry for whole day just could not believe however never more loving relationship been shown movie then Maureen Dani they really can make through anything giving movie because didnt want Court die but still one most amazing movies have ever seen
