Dont understand how these animated movies keep coming out matter how good bad people love saw movie with two kids They like pretty much anything animated like most people who rated film theater almost full looked forward seeing movie with superb cast tell truth bored silly unbelievably predictable just plain unfunny There were couple chuckles throughout film course they tried time time again get cheap laugh but just didnt work son almost always says wants DVD after see animated movie but not one daughter fell asleep half way through Also kids thought character animation looked weird havent heard from them since seeing Polar Express which gave daughter nightmares Trust not type who looks for negative everything But quality quality like many animated movies they throw out there very little
