completely agree with other comment someone should Whats tiger Lily with film one worst french films Ive seen long time actually along with Brotherwood Wolves horrendous films much too short period time really sad because cast really interesting original idea kind fun Antoine DeCaunes particular Jean Rochefort among darlings bitterly disappointed see them compromised such poor film Lou Doyon quite bad usual which goes prove pretty face famous parents can get you into movies but they dont necessarily give you talent avoid film you want laugh watch Alain Chabat instead some nice period piece full fun like FILLE DARTAGNAN
