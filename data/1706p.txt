Pierce Brosnan newest but longer James Bond assassin very very good what does but getting old tired Greg Kinnair really good straight narrow business man Now when story opens movie shows these two people their separate lives Then one night they are having drinks bar they begin talk Then all sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during series events story excellent acting top notch humor hilarious never thought Pierce Brosnan would funny but really must say movie must see
