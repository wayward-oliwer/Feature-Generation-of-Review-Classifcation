While would say enjoy show expected something completely different from when first saw What like about you expected find something along lines All not sure anymore but have say like show while dont classify breakthrough show very charming like chemistry between characters well including supporting cast would definitely say great see Wesley Jonathan back screen because really loved him City Guy had also seen woman who plays Valeries friend Popular while think okay show not really like her character show because shes just not cup tea but she rounds out pretty well
