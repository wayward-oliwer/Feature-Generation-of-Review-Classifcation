William Powell doctor dealing with murder exwife ExMrs Bradford also starring Jean Arthur Eric Blore James Gleason seems Powell had chemistry with just about any woman with whom teamed Though Myrna Loy were perfect screen couple actor made couple other Thin Man type movies one with Ginger Rogers one with Arthur both very good effect Somehow one never gets tired seeing Powell witty debonair professional ExMrs Bradford exception exMrs served with subpoena for back alimony then moves back help him solve mystery shes dragged him into isnt first time shes done almost seems though there Bradford film before one intended first series films complains mysterywriter constantly bringing him into cases time jockey riding favorite horse raise mysteriously falls off horse dies right before finish line solution case kind outlandish but beside point point banter between couple interference exMrs Jean Arthur quite glamorous her role very funny However with actress who comes off brainy Arthur does humor seems intentional rather than featherbrained suspect writer had something else mind say wacky side Carole Lombard When Arthur hears police have arrived she says probably about alimony Ive been waiting for police take hand more rib Powell rather than serious statement still works well shows how good actress can make part her own Definitely worth watching William Powell Jean Arthur always were
