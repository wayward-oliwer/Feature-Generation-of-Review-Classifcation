Well maybe version game impressive Maybe just finished playing PS2 version pretty much complete mess There are couple elements are okay promising Ill mention those first because will over quickly First idea historical GTAlike game great one game Gun historical GTAlike game unlike Mafia Gun excellent love see game set during Mafias era done right Next storyline well written story makes sense dramatic arcs uses unusual device with much game backstory interesting Finally some graphicsespecially those used during cutscenesare impressive Mafias designers seemed focus getting graphics right places where GTA skimped effort especially characters Unfortunately many other areas graphics kinda stink much rather have excellent gameplay than impressivelooking characters gameplay what sinks title low First off controls camera absolutely suck first focus any game developers You cant release game where controls andor camera suck Number one theres reason players character Tom cant have full range motion controlled left analog stick Unless absolutely necessary hardly ever hate setup where left stick moves character strafing way character can only turn using right analog stick Here not only unnecessary makes most simplest actions challenge For example Tom climb couple missions But game designed poorly you have frustratingly keep manipulating both right analog stick camera then press every time you need climb Tom will descend instead Next Ive never seen worse fighting system first problem you cant autoaim lock any targets one early point game seems tell you you can use lock targets but never worked focus any enemy you have struggle with stupid right analog stick try keep adjusting both characters orientation camera which tends drift wrong angle make Tom disappear all time time youre probably getting pummeled shot death Next youre touching almost touching enemyand certainly case for hand hand combat when using melee weapons fighting systemwhich primarily consists tapping holding completely useless Enemies can pummel you almost bear hug but you just cant move unless you back off close fighting tends consist you yanking left analog stick yelling character move away which wont time then tapping much you can before enemy gets too close again makes useless enemy changes their angle you meantime youre also struggle with right analog stick get your character oriented right way get camera position you can see anything time youre probably getting pummeled shot again your only option will try move character away again fights often consisted making Tom run circles around area like comedy film hoping could gain enough time struggle with analog stick get couple shots before mercy again much for realistic fighting same problems more exist when trying fight with guns youre touching someone half time controller just wont allow you fire off shot yet they can still riddle you full holes Additionally theres autoaim aiming system ridiculously sensitive even with sensitivity set zero under Options Gunfights tend consist you hopelessly trying aim move away while enemy puts shot after shot into you Luckily not damage seems recorded almost randomly can take one ten shots more incapacitate any character theres rhyme reason You can put five shots into enemys head near point blank range theyll still return fire hurt you Yet game designers seemed care enough about realism than they built recoil into your aiming system after shots with powerful enough guns your aim will float off target youll have fight with again for celebrated graphics except for characters textures youre close theyre actually pretty disappointing distance always seems mostly empty there are often expanses flat colors textures nearby when youre driving city wasnt very well designed not varied enough there arent many interesting things see cars seem slow theyre difficult control They also all drive about same Some have mentioned music but also pretty nondescript much better job could have been done end Also many others have mentioned load times are ridiculous constant They tend over minute long they occur between middle everythingeven races Overall Mafia port PS2 least seems have been very rushed game feels plays like incomplete hack job
