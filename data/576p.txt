original Vampires 1998 one favorites curious see how sequel would work considering they used none original characters quite surprised how played out rule sequels are never good original with few exceptions Though one not great movie writer did well keeping main themes vampire lore from first one tact Jon Bon Jovi drawback initially but proved halfway decent Slayer doubt anyone could top James Woods performance first one though unless you bring Buffy All all decent watch would watch again left with two questions though what happened Jack Crow how did Derek Bliss come slayer Guess well just have leave imagination
