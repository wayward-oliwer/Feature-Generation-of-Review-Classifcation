Lots reviews page mention movie little dark for kids depends kid isnt movie for year old more geared toward years older crowd saw movie when absolutely loved time most animated movies were little too childish for tastes movie deals with more serious issues therefore little more emotional impact movie characters can DIE sent HELL gives little more emotional weight scenes where characters are risking their lives good guys arent always perfectly sweet nice like other cartoons They have real motivations like revenge greed but also compassion friendship shows things arent always black white Excellent Movie
