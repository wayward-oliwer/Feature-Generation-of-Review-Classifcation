Disney now made straighttovideo sequels good bunch their many animated features Two these were made for their 1991 classic Beauty Beast Well these ones arent really sequels they are both set between events first film first these two straighttovideo films Beauty Beast Enchanted Christmas which seems disliked quite few fans theatrical predecessor but think can usually expected with sequels However second one Belles Magical World definitely inferior film features three short stories all which take place while Belle castle place under spell enchantress first Perfect Word where misunderstanding table between Belle Beast leads trouble neither wants first apologize next story Fifis Folly where Fifi Lumieres fifth anniversary coming Lumiere unprepared Belle helps him However Fifi sees Lumiere practicing romance with Belle thinks theyre actually love film ends with Broken Wing story Belle takes care bird with broken wing but bird castle will probably mean trouble Beast finds out hates birds plot description gave for original version Disneys third Beauty Beast movie Apparently DVD version there another story called Pottss Party but Ive only seen original version However since highly doubt one story would stand out classic over rest see point watching special edition Anyway first thing will say about Belles Magical World animation very 2dimensional compared what were used from Disney which would obviously disappoint many people didnt like Beauty Beast Enchanted Christmas much but you certainly cant say same about animation sure stories Belles Magical World could entertain many kids mostly younger ones think each story moral they could also teach them some valuable lessons However for adults film really doesnt have lot personally didnt find any good humour found constant conflict between Belle Beast got tiring stories did not impress too much all any way theyre not very well written Perfect Word way Belle says Beast Youre acting rude foolish bit cheesy think there are quite few other cheesy moments these stories time straighttovideo movie first came out around eleven twelve years old dont know what would have thought time had lost interest Disney then would years before would gain any interest back Even when movie first released think bit past age group aimed never saw Beauty Beast Enchanted Christmas until couple months ago but unlike film never even heard one until recently think just after seeing first sequel Disneys 1991 hit Well much like theatrical original wouldnt have been missing much never became aware films existence For little kids sure Belles Magical World can highly entertaining probably somewhat educational with morals but not recommend for adult Disney fans
