Memoirs Geisha beautifully filmed movie there doubt about acting generally excellent least terms how portrays characters they are scripted However many details small large are just wrong just bothers too much able enjoy fully small detail typifies kind lack sensitivity sorts one scene does not spoil anything where Mameha rings bell hangs door house where Sayuri lives snowy winter day bell shes ringing fuurin wind chime only left hanging outside houses Japan summer People traditional Japanese homes didnt have doorbells they just opened door announced themselves You may think such trivial detail but would equate movie made about America where Christmas wreath hanging door July one thinks anything dont even get started totally wrong hairstyles given maiko geisha which vaguely panAsianChinesekungfuish nothing like real thing think rather cavalier attitude towards culture they are trying portray really comes out attitudes portrayals people situations too suppose less you know about Japanese culture world geisha maiko Kyoto which what Miyako then suppose more you will enjoy honestly think movie could have been much betteras just another Hollywood version exotic Japan
