saw film about twenty years ago late show still vividly remember film especially performance Robert Taylor always thought Taylor underrated actor most critics saw him solid almost dull leading man type women simply loved watch films because looks film however proved what interesting actor could did not get enough roles like during long career best performance totally believable truly villainous role From what have read very hardworking easy guy real life never fought enough for these kind roles basically would just what MGM gave him film proves could have handled more diverse difficult roles other thing remember about film how annoying Lloyd Nolans character Nolan great actor but character really aggravated last scene film stuck with for all these years film definitely worth look
