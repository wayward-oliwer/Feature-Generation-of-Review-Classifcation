Leave Paul sex brain Verhoeven come with pointlessly sleazy juvenile version INVISIBLE MAN story hed direct Pokemon film sure hed turn into some massive orgy sorts dont mind sex even sleaze check other reviews film but frankly obvious director one track mind couldnt see interesting aspects about invisible man storyline than kinky implications comes with shame because could have been good film didnt spend much time having invisible Kevin Bacon grope women game cast actors does what can with onenote cheesy script but felt bad for some them including William Devane who totally wasted here But then what could have expected from director SHOWGIRLS which btw much more entertaining than stilted bad film
