Ive heard about movie for many years finally got chance see massive murdering cheerleaders back 1963 1969 eventually cause cheerleading camp close Fast forward 1982 Bambi former student opens back with new recruits among them Candy Carol Kane Glenn Judge Reinhold Sandy Debralee Scott One one they are murdered killer until only one remains then when find out who did why Also movie are Tom Smothers terrible accent Canadian Mountie Paul Reubens PeeWee Herman schtick plot overall isnt very well developed quite lame but some funny scenes occur namely House Bad Pies strip poker scene ending seems like thrown together which shame Overall good for about ten fifteen minutes total rest you can just fast forward through Maybe catch but not worth buying
