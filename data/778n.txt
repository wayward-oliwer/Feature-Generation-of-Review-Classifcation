movie plot character development budget really sucks put short terms Since there development for movie really cant even looked trying artistic trying make statement against torture Which leaves two other reasons possibly watch shocked get off like sick little freak Well falls short here too girls reactions just seem dumb extremely easy tell fake honestly professional wrestling looks more realistic than crap they try get with movie They throw innards her but shes asleep for most just kinda dumb only really kind worthwhile part end when they quickly cut from scene scene just before needle goes into her eye But honestly girl extremely ugly everything incredibly fake with exception eye you want good movie about torture watch Hostel Hostel Not only they both contain realistic violence but there also actual storyline draws you makes you care about people Plus tow movies really work deeper level considering themes like American fears foreigners issues morality testing how far person can human instincts civilization many other things Plus they are carefully written contain some good humor when story isnt focused violence These are much better choices over piece crap
