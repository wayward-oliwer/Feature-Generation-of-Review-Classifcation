LOVE TOPthe utterly wrongheaded American title for superb French film Mouton Enrage which means think Rabid Sheep such original movie fact dates back 1974 seems all more astounding film far ahead time even todays highest standards accomplishes things seem rich new Filmed hugely underrated director Michel Deville rather defies description way combines social critique comedy mystery love sex satire into one wholly original mixleaving for end major but subtle surprise render all gone before suddenly sad more understandable cast splendid ditto writing theme But Devilles delicious tone keeping you constantly offbalance but enrapt pushes lost film very high level indeed written interview with director Special Features section DVD definitely worth reading you have time
