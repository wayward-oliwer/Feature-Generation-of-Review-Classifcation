show seemed kinda good Kyra Sedgwick actress like police series but somewhere production program went wrong First all writers should have more suspects than one you know who did EVERY TIME makes boring main character unbelievably annoying not believable any way know they wanted her tough but shes mean stupid bad chief crimes are uninteresting bland just lame all way stated above hate All all big disappointment very bad indeed
