waited for some years before movie finally got released England but many ways very pleased when finally saw There are lot great things film for start acting not something have all much need for horror picture but people film all put fine work constantly gripping interesting script with nice sorta Lovecraftian feel give film real solid backbone Add doses surreal nightmare imagery occasional gruesome gore films winner favorite kind gore too supernatural splattery Also characters Marcus angry bodybuilding transsexual Daisy mentally retarded loverplaything are genuinely freakish unnerving times give far out anything goes sense morbid grown craziness which works well with frequent Freudian overtones one most impressive recent horror movies far more shocking out there than anything Hollywood can produce only gripe wanted ending darker tone but still works whole really recommend serious horror buffs
