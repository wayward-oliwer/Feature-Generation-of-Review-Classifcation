What heck Somebody obviously read Stephen King Sartre same semester get existential angst mixed with cheap horror There were moments were disturbing but each one canceled out horrible music CGI acting problem with weird narratives like feels lazy Even David Lynchs work feels like times just like interesting shows movies runs far far too long sadly only minutes cast attractive about limit suppose touches feelings adolescents fear loneliness all have but just doesnt make characters likable enough for care about their fateswhatever they were final scene leaves whole thing ambiguous
