ordinary moviewatcher cant say enjoyed watching one not too emotional for drama not too gripping for thriller not too fast for action Plus some moments movie are hardly credible understand soldiers become bit out their mind out there but hard believe person would risk life carjack into middle hostile city after shouted professors wife run away without having asked question proper way would seem terribly romantic were animation but supposed SERIOUS film about war There are several episodes like whole picture makes impression just raw preview movie needs considerable work feels like movie makers wanted create image emotional brave soldier but all these curves psychology seem simply unnatural picture left question head WHY Why they gave Oscar Why SIX IMHO most thrilling part movie
