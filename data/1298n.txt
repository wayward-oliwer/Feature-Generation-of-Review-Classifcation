rarely comment films but Ive read other comments cannot believe there are people applauding celluloid rubbish know there are certain people who have their own agenda but lets take merit poorly acted badly shot story felt director making along not focus sexual aspect film involving little kids makers film obviously knew what they wanted what their audience would want All can say terrible film content poor offensive production amateurish glad they could not make film like legally today
