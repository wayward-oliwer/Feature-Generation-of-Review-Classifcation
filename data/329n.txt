dumb comedy really does good job wasting comedic talent particular Dan Aykroyd Howard Hesseman are misused badly here might have chuckled once twice during film but general boring movie with little bit stupidity thrown for good measure premise although routine still wasnt bad but once plot set film went nowhere Dont waste your time with misfire
