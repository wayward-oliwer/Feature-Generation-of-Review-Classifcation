Ive seen Mystery Men cop bit stick press with general public take imdb vote for instance but overall feeling Mystery Men more fun than most films definitely wittier than most socalled comedy films very nearly clever cast superb Greg Kinnear excellent are Geoffrey Rush Tom Waits Kinnears limo scene with Ricky Jay perfect spoiled movie star imbues character with right balance comic book quality realism make him work will admit pacing little off places visuals are certainly very flash bang possibly detriment further characterisation but end day high concept film making about little moments Whats Tiger Lily there are many great ones film make worth repeated viewing
