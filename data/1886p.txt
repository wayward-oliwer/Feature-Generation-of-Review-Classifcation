feel movie amazing Adam Sandlers performance very inspiring played very rattled fragile character took ability very edge really worked role character really interesting can see myself reading script for movie not half interested part Sandler made For someone who plays primarily comedy roles pulled off serious role with what seemed own quirks input especially loved scene which Adam Dons characters rode motorized scooter around city familiarized with moment because seemed like Don witnessing one thing Adam does get away from all With video games music many other things does keep him from thinking about past riding scooter with headphones seemed like escape from thoughts movie definitely worth watch
