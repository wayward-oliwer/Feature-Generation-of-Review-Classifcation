Well heard from somewhere Ossessione precursor Italian film genre particular favourite mine Giallobut actually aside from fact thriller made Italy two have pretty much relation sixties seventies Italian filmmakers would get themselves reputation for ripping off just about every successful American film released Theyve not done here but Ossessione does follow almost exact same story later American film Postman Always Rings Twice without giving books author James Cain much credit Anyway plot focuses Gino Costa handsome drifter who chance stumbles upon caf√© where woman named Giovanna Bragana works soon learns shes married Giuseppe big fat annoying man whom Giovanna cant stand have even touching her wants pair them run away together but shes not keen idea However fate ends intervening her plan have her husband murdered successful Despite fact film loses some credibility for not crediting author whose story based said director Luchino Visconti implements film noir style well way even prefer atmosphere film some bigger American noir classics story you would expect extremely strong Visconti manages pull good performances out cast Visconti drags film out little bit too much however with running time almost 135 minutes felt story too thin warrant kind length almost feel guilty for levelling all criticism Ossessione good film but not great film relationship between two central characters never really explored properly seems like film keener distract from rather than let into characters heads Theres not much mystery plot pretty much always know whats not always focusing characters themselves film not interesting could have been Still makes for interesting viewing comes recommended for reasonalthough not good 1946 version same James Cain classic
