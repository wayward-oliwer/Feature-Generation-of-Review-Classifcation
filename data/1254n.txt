From critical acclaim expected more from movie from Tamara Jenkins story just meandered along didnt seem have point plot find hard believe year old girl mature for her age would blase about getting loss her virginity over with Maybe too young relate four years old 1976 but didnt have any problems connecting with stories Shakespeare Love Life Beautiful wasnt alive for either those settings cast very good but unfortunately for them script did not alow them engage audience Overall Slums had moments but unless you are yearning reminisce over halter tops tube socks would say skip one
