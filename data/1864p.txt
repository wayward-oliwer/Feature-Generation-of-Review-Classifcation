dont know why some people criticise show much great funny show probably not right material for mainstream primetime but still family dynamics are funny all all same you see most comedy shows supporting characters are absolutely hilarious plots individual episodes frequent Siegfried Roy jibes are only just above average but ever often you have subplots oneliners make you roll floor laughing show well worth Pounds paid for rating 810
