bought DVD for brother who big Michelle Pfeiffer fan decided watch myself earlier week reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines section with Michelle Pfeiffer far more interesting two She plays rising Hollywood actress who had many short unfulfilling relationships She literally bumps into Brian Kerwin regular married guy with Kidsafter driving her car into back After initially hostile one another offers drive her home she longer feels comfortable drive Romance develops eventually leading tragedy when wife finds out What happens end not prepared for but slow pacing routine direction takes any drama out plot other section involves old Studio boss played Darren McGavin section actually better cast with Kenneth McMillan Lois Chiles Steven Bauer Stella Stevens They all want something from studio boss but end when asked resign they all realize their careers will now nowhere passes time but not all interesting glad not bought for not Michelle Pffeifer fan but she admittedly only actor worth watching film even 1983 she decent actress Overall though unless you are fan hers avoid very routine
