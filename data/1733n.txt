movie bewilders may just stupid American but really just dont get 400 Blows Everything Ive read about movie been total rave but just couldnt stay interested sure revolutionary filmmaking all critics say but when boils right down just really really boring Maybe language barrier may just not sensitive artsy enough but whatever case hated movie story itself isnt bad about young French boy who treated unfairly parents teachers eventually ends juvenile facility itself ought interesting first There nothing wrong with dialogue but then again hard say because half conversations werent subtitled for apparent reason didnt always know what But for dialogue could understand made enough sense actors were believable enough but hard say what real person would these situations you feel for main character but only sense when gets into trouble you think well sucks plot isnt even your typical plot Each time gets trouble gets into more trouble than last time but reasons never vary too much through entire film you realize theres nothing main character can really about more like just waiting see how ends ending way completely over head way too artsy for just didnt get Leading end easy enough follow structure certainly there made sense well but everything really drawn out For amount dialogue significant moments movie could have been hour shorter just didnt end Part unnecessarily long shots none which were especially memorable for example ending clip main character running down country road lasted good thirty seconds Now sure had some deeper meaning somewhere but for average viewer rather have gotten get some more food during time least done something little more useful than sit watch boy running like laundry taking nap Final Verdict feeling throughout whole movie probably would very moving just amazing would teach some great life lesson could only get what director trying say unique decisions just felt cheated out good two hours life
