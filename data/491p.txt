saw Mar yesterday thought great movie starts with childhood episode life main characters Ramallo Manuel Tur Francisca After jump about years hospital where friends meet again Religion sickness love violence sexuality rage throughout movie creating intense tensionfilled movie see people complaining about film too gory think they missed point story violent intense sad story People are expected suffer cry get hurt bleed think what film shows isnt done for pure shockvalue presented distasteful way know some people like their films clean even those with violence But sometimes movie needs make you feel unconfortable work one those movies great movie only fault found there were moments were some plot details werent 100 clear only after thinking about them end movie all made sense But wasnt anything much importance overall story still give movie
