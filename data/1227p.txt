Omigosh seriously scariest movie have ever ever seen say love horror movies would understatement have seen heaps considering limited availability New Zealand quite lot but never before have had sleep with light onuntil saw Grudge Some may say rip off Ring both based Japanese horror movies both similar yet different story lines but Grudge holds own terrifying movie seeing cinema even screamed certain point movie acting great particularly from supporting characters KaDee Strickland fantastic steals show she such enthusiastic person Jason Behr real hottie William Mapother looks like having fun However while normally fan Clea DuValls she doesnt really seem into movie supporting characters hers probably got most depth back story but she doesnt seem like she all there for Sarah Michelle Gellar well she stays about same through all her films roles doesnt she ghosts were genuinely scary music sound effects were chilling particularly noise made when KaDee Stricklands character answered phone her apartment ending cool too Super highly recommended 910
