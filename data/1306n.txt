purchased film cheap sale having read back DVD case assuming either way cant lose rubbish then loss any good then bargain Then watched normally fan Christopher Walken but film commanded very little screen presence seeming not whole lot even death friend near beginning which sparks off action plot seems affect him very little eventual revenge just boring undramatic Normally film which themes grand revolution revenge are able capture audience snare them into feeling something for characters however watching film felt more like seeing series confused almost random events loosely tied together towards eventual conclusion point wept thought film most horribly painful piece viewing have ever been subjected scene where pilot sacrifices himself refusing jump out explosive laden truck due not wanting kill any civilians not much tragically sad unnervingly horrible painful although not quite bad emergency surgery wounded girl acting poor all round script story weak action even weaker visuals were but bluntly not all visual summarise there are films which are good films are bad films are bad they are good films are terrible then whole new level McBain
