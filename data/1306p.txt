Definitely one lesser AstaireRogers musicals just very poorly plotted paced only runs few minutes longer than Swing Time for example but feels heck lot longer partly due secondary romance between Randolph Scott Harriet Hilliard Scott rarely ever interesting like Hilliard Shes sweet love least one her songs But Where Are You Get Thee Behind Satan her other number weak leftover from Top Hat thankfully cut from masterpiece Follow Fleet would actually bad film not for least three brilliant dance sequences between Astaire Rogers dancing contest vies for top spot any their numbers dance just fantastic Putting All Eggs One Basket presents two rehearsing dance they dont quite have perfected yet imperfections make all more perfect Lets Face Music Dance easily one Irving Berlins best songs film well worth watching for great moments
