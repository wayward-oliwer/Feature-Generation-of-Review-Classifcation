good movie but not recommended you dont like intelligent movies about two guys wish world would awayand exactly what they get acting great ending not predictableand actually had good story unlike most movies these days People complain about movie too simple too boring think they should just stick movies like Toxic Avenger actually like movies Grim Adventures Billy Mandy One note you notice exactly same actors from Cube except four actors Make two notes Wait after credits Trust one Enjoy movie
