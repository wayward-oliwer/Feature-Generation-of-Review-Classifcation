film recipient 1990 Academy award for Best Animated Short Film Over last few weeks have seen dozens nominees recipients award from last years really think film might just worst them allyet wasnt just nominee but won assume 1989 must have just been horrible year for genre film shows group characters look bit like superskinny Uncle Festers appear simple articulated figures who are moved using stop motion animation All are identicalwith same faces bodies clothes only difference each different number drawn their backs They are all standing large platform suspended magic space Each pole their also box platform platform begins tilting slightly response men move about effort balance platform goes for longest time only relief from tedium when one them acts rather nasty towards end but just isnt enough make fun watch least Aside from passable stop motion animation short offers nothing interest meNOTHING way great short KNICK KNACK also came out 1989 have idea why not among nominees GREAT short far better than any nominees year year before Perhaps Pixars success previous years resulted bias against them but KNICK KNACK clever funny seems almost criminal have ignored Could Pixar have not entered seems unlikely
