When you see Boris Karloff Bela Lugosi costars you expect find well done horror movie but actually quite different representing did what would describe early effort science fiction Karloff Lugosi both play scientists Rukh Benet respectively competitors extent until Rukh wins Benet over with demonstration proves great theory science here say least bit rough around edges thus science fiction with emphasis fiction but somehow Rukh harnesses some sort ray from Andromeda allows him look earth several thousand million years ago pre historic time huge meteorite slammed into Africa leaving deposits substance scientists call Radium which can heal destroy large portion movie set rather tediously Africa search for meteorite deposits which Rukh eventually finds harnesses create great weapon unfortunately infecting himself with some sort disease makes him great weapon well Karloff Lugosi were both pretty good here Lugosi pulls off role which good guy pretty well although frankly found him bit unconvincing especially during scenes set Africa story also plodded along bit while held attention didnt captivate Given really scifi rather than horror flick scifi very early stages suppose movie needs cut bit slack nothing more but also nothing less than 410
