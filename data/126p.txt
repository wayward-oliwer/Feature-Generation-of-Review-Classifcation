didnt really know what expect when out watch film apart from slightly surreal basic plotline lonely man orders Russian bride over internet had Nicole Kidman absolutely loved film though came out thinking wow Refreshingly down earth film moves along nicely with few suprises each corner relationships film are believeable with Nicole Chaplin working against each other beautifully humour subtle with some great Officelike scenes bank thriller element add tension without Hollywood Overall film about real people unusual situation less about heroics more about delicate relationships Britfilmmaking best 910
