Okay plot shaky ground Yeah all right there are some randomly inserted song andor dance sequences for example Adams concert Henris stage act Leslie Caron cant really you know act But somehow American Paris manages come through all polished firstrate musicallargely basis Gene Kellys incredible dancing talent choreography truckloads charm seems importing into each scene with Caron needs because she seems have problem with emoting most accomplished technically aweinspiring number musical obviously 16minute ballet towards end film stunningly filmed Kelly Caron dance beautifully But favourite number would have Kellys character singing Got Rhythm with bunch French schoolchildren then breaking into array American dances just goes prove how you dont need special effects when youve got some real talent Not classics level with Singin Rain but pretty high there nonetheless Worth watch
