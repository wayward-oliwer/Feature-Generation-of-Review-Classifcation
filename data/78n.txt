OMG only reason giving movie instead because Tom Hanks funny Elvisinthebox Apart from how did halfway decent cast sign such lame movie Maybe seemed like good idea time There are laughs mention stereotypes are pathetic cast wasted direction amateurish Now think about most blame probably lies with director Joel Zwick brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved Dont waste your time like did but then enjoy good train wreck Geez now system telling need more lines here movie should called Return Sender Okay now funnier than anything movie
