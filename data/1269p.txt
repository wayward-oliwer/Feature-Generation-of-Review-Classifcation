beautiful new print Zabriskie Point playing Paris seems well Latin Quarter time for full evaluation film Lets hope new print means DVD with some insightful extras will out near future remember watching when came out thought crashing bore time around totally awed would classify nearmiss masterpiece first part movie time capsule late Angeles lived there then Antonioni did masterful job capturing essence place Kudos production designer Dean Tavoularis who found some incredible locations did outstanding work print saw runs hour minutes forbidden those under cant remember suspect there quite bit restored footage print SPOILER wonder how much desert sex scene originally cut What appears today seems rather tame current standards There soundtrack music until almost hour into film Before hear extraneous noise such radio broadcasts etc Antonioni very daring remember how much made time lack acting skills nonactors Mark Frechette Daria Halprin time Frechette did not bother Halprin weaker but gradually improves film continues Much student riot footage looks like stock footage One shot different aspect ratio distorted wide screen course there actual staged footage but not all much still trying figure out how Antonioni did some shots Frechette flying plane looks like really did some flying theres blue screen double some shots hope get back see film second time Recommended highly all Antonioni fans
