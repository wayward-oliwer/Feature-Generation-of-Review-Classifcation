read one other review expressed view Platoon never ending cycle marines killing people killed taking drugs talking trash dont agree with because film actually had more but way can see what person trying say had real plot which point agree with selfindulgent Stone best really wanted show not only how war leads death but also how extremely traumatic those who survive Unfortunately film seems over glorify aspect grand finale just way too champagne grandstanding Oscarhunting lets create enduring image for liking problem have with Stone other filmmakers ilk they fail understand simply concept depicting terribly bloody deadly waste war DOES NOT PROVE EVEN REFLECT WHETHER unjust immoral war have seen same thing emerge moment with Iraq case youre missing point let put you bluntly you saw how truly bloody second world war how destructive lives surviving soldiers would you think unjust war fact alone doesnt convince you unjust war then why should depictions horrors Vietnam convince you wrong war instance Personally not support Americas decision war Vietnam but certainly dont subscribe war wrong because people died suffered theory dont think motivations are always wrong default just because war itself terrible says nothing fact ending final big twist bit stupid However not Stones first oddball departure Wall street magnificent film until last minutes when made dreadful wrong turn JFK probably one few films Stone did actually ended very well But hardly matters one because there very little plot until point film twist around why gave such low mark virtually storyless ultimately boring unless you fell for manufactured poignancy
