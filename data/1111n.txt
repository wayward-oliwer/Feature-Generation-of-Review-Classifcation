sat through movie evening forcing myself stick with even though never cared about any characters what happened them because two leads Gérard Philippe Michèle Morgan were major film stars their era wanted see them something different which certainly They both gave fine performances but distasteful characters Indeed whole movie about shabby little town Mexico inhabited almost uniformly distasteful characters doctor course major exception What Michèle Morgan ever sees Philippe fall love with him never explained supposedly based work JeanPaul Sartre All could think Sartres work anything like movie must very mediocre attempt imitating Camus masterful novel Plague which dealt with plague North Africa wellacted but uninteresting movie
