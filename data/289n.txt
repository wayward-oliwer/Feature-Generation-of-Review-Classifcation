Just another example why Stepehn Kings books should not made into movies Even Carrie one best ruined adaptation from book screen premise story revolves around fat lawyer always diet who accidentally kills old gypsy woman court with help judge local police chief gets off even though accident sort fault not paying attention driving father dead gypsy woman places curse with our main character Billy lawyer getting thinner thinner day Though movie kept with book for most part your typical King ending acting stilted felt forced went from one scene next without much anything between sort like reading acts play King himself made cameo movie sort like Dave Barry which reinforces belief authors should stay just authors Leave acting actors Not anyone movie great Ive seen major characters movies where they were much better
