Shiner directed Christian Calson centers around three couples their relationships with obsession violence Pretty good start far concerned Interesting couples break down into heterosexual couple two heterosexual male friends straight guy harmlessly stalked gay man het couple really dont have much role film There are some scenes show how they like aggressive when having sex playing around with each other but seem have real purpose since are marginalized assumption they represent more day day illustration how sexviolence are integrated couples life couple arent very aggressive not even shot any kind erotic way characters they dont add much theme plot two male friends make bulk plot They engage some gay bashing sorts convincing homosexual man have sex with them alley escalates into violence violence changes them becomes means sexual gratification their need for violence release grows film progresses main problem had violence not convincing Never once does seem any characters any real danger just doesnt work Given whole theme film about characters relationships with violence major problem Unfortunately makeup doesnt help either Sometimes okay other times very bad one scene really wondered why one characters had rouge smeared face Confusing more interesting pair characters stalker couple Here Calson seemed have more say able develop more coherent storyline Perhaps because characters seem develop more have resolution end Shiner may well have been much better had stuck with these two appreciate Calson wanted achieve lot with film admirable Most low budget flicks dont aspire much dont think Calson achieved want aiming for Myself found nothing particularly controversial unsettling Shiner unconvincing doesnt mean however director cant achieve something with next film seems have something say
