Let first state while have viewed every episode StarTrek least twice not consider myself Trekker Trekkie Those are people who live their parents basement attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears gave movie seven casting aside fiction historical errors acting better than average but plot held surprises They tried very hard reverse engineer technology but still special effects were just great temptation Now historical errors you call them first Capitan pilot Enterprise Commander April then Capt Pike Jim Kirk etc According statement made both Riker Kirk dicovered Klingons educated them gave them technology reason prime directive created but like said these are reason discredit fine series hope plots will get deeper then special effects can take backseat
