What you get when you have bad acting bad directing scenes are excruciatingly long terrible lighting painful editing effects You get Jessica Ghost Story Seems shot betacam which fine but lighting compliment medium case does not There are few where persons face entirely shadow One scene particular scene psychiatrists joke you ask Some scenes were long they could have easily been cut half but guess then they wouldnt have film feature length main character incredibly flat LEAD male should have some hero elements character but does not whines scared entire film could but dont want waste time Although lighting terrible must say they did have nice camera movement Too bad lighting didnt compliment cover DVD nice where ends Just terrible
