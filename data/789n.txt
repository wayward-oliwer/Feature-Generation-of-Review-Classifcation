First let say not Dukes fan but after movie series looked like Law Order worst thing casting Roscoe Boss Hogg Burt Reynolds not Boss Hogg even worse Gainey Roscoe they ever watched show Roscoe not hard ass cop more Barney Fife than role played movie movie loaded with usual errors cars getting torn continues like nothing happened worst example when General gets together with Billy Prickett General ran into dirt hill obviously slowing near stop but goes win race
