For those who think Dame May Witty kindly slightly batty old lady from Hitchcocks Lady Vanishes movie requires adjustment Here shes anything but kindly batty Instead her son George Macready loony one Just dont give him knife otherwise eyes light furniture cushion house safe Now know what mind for trapped Nina Foch can just get out from under Mothers domineering hand Really tight little womanindanger film keeps suspense high throughout script never strays from Fochs dilemma Shes held prisoner big old Gothic house edge angry sea Theyre kill her but why Her predicament makes sense tension mounts she tries one escape ploy after another but even strangers seem against her begin feel her helplessness mounting paranoia world turns away from her Director Joseph Lewis took big step toward cult status with film understandably Then too watch Foch run subtly through gamut emotions without once over top Witty too shines really intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants how get she can just keep her wacko son line one reservation climax which seems too contrived considering timing events Nonetheless good nervewracking way spend little over hour courtesy Columbia studios
