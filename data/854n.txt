film pretty poor acting abysmal completely forced Furthermore shooting film docudrama doesnt necessarily make more believable you cant get out easily Dir Dont let comments mislead you however would recommend you watch film does shed some light psychology non existent psychology behind perpetrators such crimes However climax film absolutely rubbish There other way put pure simply fails capture any sense atmosphere What takes place does not translate any feelings desperation panic fear dread one would surely experience such terrifying circumstances instead leaves you with jaw dropping spilling from your tongue means are you haunted these boys actions Rather you just feel embarrassed for yet another film started with potential but ended falling flat face most crucial pointZero Day indeedzzzzzzzzzzzzz
