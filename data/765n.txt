movie one worst ones year main characters have chemistry acting horrible Paul Rudd only one any talent only one not annoying have never watched Desparte Housewives dont know how Eva Longoria show but movie she horrible like she knows nothing about acting All her character does whine throughout film she cant pull off still entertaining other girl Lake Bell displays little emotion like you are looking cue cards she reads them for story cookie cutter goes from point with little surprise much more could have been used with Kate ghost plot should have revolved more around her things she does spirit FINAL VERDICT not worth watching
