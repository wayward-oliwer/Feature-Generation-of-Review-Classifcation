Zatoichi movies Star Trek movies were Star Trekexcept case every one originals more entertaining interesting than big shiny redo also better made substance more important than surface Had never seen them would have thought goodlooking but empty since had thought style inappropriate content insufficient idea reviving character bigger slicker production must have sounded good but there point other than hope making money just show which mostly fails capture atmosphere characters world wholly fails take character anywhere hasnt been already also actor wasnt best been hoping see Ichi late stage life story would see him out gracefully draw some conclusion from experience overall just rehashes bits pieces from other movies seasoned with more sex sfx violence Not same experience all
