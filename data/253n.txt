First off title character not even main character movie sidekick cult leader actor who portrays Igor believed screaming loud laughing hysterically having crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would excellent way scare people Igor also had annoying habit yelling because never actually just spoke high pitched voice would also say idiotic oneliners For example when cult leader murders one followers with buzz saw Igor upon seeing yells out Paul Paul Whyd you could have cut her clean clean another scene Igor tells victim she would have get her own tools for surgery because right now time operate Aside from bad acting ending did not make sense because while story builds what little steam towards climax which Igor getting crossbow arrow head rest lunatic buddies killed shows again two more times kill remaining good guys movie offers explanation only telling viewer Igor escaped from mental hospital What Bottom line not waste your time watching movie wish could get back moments lost watching
