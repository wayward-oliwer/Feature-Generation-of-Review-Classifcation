first minutes Dragon Fighter are entirely acceptable surprisingly watchable characters are believable interesting cloning lab looks really hightech After all collapses characters start behaving idiotically new subplot introduced from nowhere about fusion reactor supposedly present day critical only plot justification which required kill dragon only doesnt finish incredibly weak One wonders what made movie started out well turn wrong All characters except Dean Cain are played Russians results some weird situations details like character played Vessela Dimitrova called Bailey Kent despite her heavy accent despite her one occasion inexplicably switching Spanish Because decent start considered rating movie but really more disappointing than only give
