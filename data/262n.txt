Italian semihorror movie starts out very much like soft core porn movie turns into mystery few many loose ends good fact rather dull just makes film rather unwatchable for tastes only thing really worth watching are many boobs spread throughout film story guy who beginning movie luring girls castle where proceeds take them dungeon berserk seemingly kill them They show nudity but they never really show murders point film Then guy finds nice red head party proceeds make out with her marry her thing for red heads you see beloved former wife Evelyn also one she also died under circumstances must have not been viewing audiences business After lot talky scenes murders start take place involving snakes foxes such point easy enough figure out who responsible for murders what motive then you have nonsensical ending where everything wraps not nicely movie just did not work for left with many questions last third film just did not have boobs first two thirds film Explaining Evelyns death would have helped film would have some sort ending where Evelyn did rise from grave Granted title not totally misleading she did sort leave grave just not under her own power gore very light for most part there scene with foxes scene end with quite bit blood too just thought for most part movie tad dull
