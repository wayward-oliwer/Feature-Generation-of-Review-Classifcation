have say although movie formulaic throughout with plot stolen from films like Friday 13thI Know What You Did Last Summer movie wasnt bad fact wasnt bad most Horror films Hollywood released recently killings although times little too imaginative were most instances just original cast mediocre which expected from lowbudget features but much better than what much bigger studio ArtisanLions Gate been offering only real complaint wasnt due films budget which must have been small contrived twist ending sorry but what put film bad category for ending just stupid tacked Before little bored but actually enjoying 410
