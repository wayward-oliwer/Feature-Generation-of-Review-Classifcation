film not nearly much chore expected There are few seconds brilliance somewhat idiotic hardcore UFO conspiracy paranoiafest Most acting mediocre but fairly typical for 1970sstyle stuff replete with pregnant pauses photographer model witness some strange goingson woods soon fall victim these same goingson Flying saucers are spotted more people disappear but aliens our own governments ultrasecret group coverup guys Soon enough reporter UFOlogist apparently modeled character writerdirector are drawn into unraveling fiasco become target ultrasecret agents who are menacing they are improbable witless Then fun really begins movie predictably makes about much sense average UFO conspiracy theory but should commended for taking itself seriously camera work for lowbudget film pacing pretty good script silly absurd there are continuity issues which are fun look out for What are few seconds brilliance mentioned Honestly cant say much you without writing spoiler Suffice say end film least worth fastforwarding you cant take middle
