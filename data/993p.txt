havent seen film years knowledge little rusty remember thinking film twice film Braveheart simply more realistic more believable characters Ridb Roy looks like one would imagine Rob Roy look like messy hair beard with simple clothing Also Liam Nesson Celtic look about him looks like Scot more importantly looks like Rob Roy comparison which angers some people but compare him Mel Gibson William Wallace Gibson supposedly playing man whos legend caused him described foot giant while Gibson almost foot shorter story contains little romance conspiracy underdog story Sound anything like Braveheart But instead film cries out freedom liberty nationalism get film which says honour love justice makes more interesting film Much like Gladiator cast fantastic Liam Nesson very strong leader endeavour story great with how deals with heroism humanity scene where Mary raped she walks out burning house with look true Scottish strength followed her washing semen from her crotch extreme panic something heroine Braveheart would never Overall stunning almost flawless watch see
