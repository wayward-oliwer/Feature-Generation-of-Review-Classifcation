Ive watched movie second time try figure out why wasnt successful commercially artistically should have been discovered considerable artistic meritwhich may ultimately have been commercial undoing First all movie attempts serious sciencefiction social commentary more than actionadventure There action but not really what about you focus youll end with others have noted bad Aliens clone But again not what about movie really about Todds Kurt Russell transformation from human nearmachine back human mostly back But because not trying give you typically glib Hollywood style answer Kurt Russell must make transformation without speaking largely without broad expressions really does wonderful jobit can take two viewings appreciate surrounding social logic flawed never adequately explained whether Todds ability hold own against army supposedly superior troops comes from experience battlefield newfound humanness what but movie still makes marvellous showcase for Russells easy underestimate talent
