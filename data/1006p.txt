Ogre doesnt seem have won itself very good reputation since release 1988 guess reason for may down fact given subtitle Demons order help sell better Well film directed Lamberto Bava man behind first two Demons films ogres demons are somewhat alike theyre both monsters anywaybut other than film connections other two films however rather good Italian filmmakers are famous for ripping off popular films while not completely obvious seems one taken fair bit influence from Hellraiser plot focuses female horror writer who moves with her husband son castle Italy She haunted memories from when she child found Ogre living her basement not long after moving into castle before these visions returnand may more than just coincidence she comes believe theres murderous ogre living basement film obviously shot budget made for Italian would unrealistic expect something brilliant but for what certainly very decent horror film Lamberto Bava may not have keen eye father Mario did but takes time building foreboding atmosphere really compliments film well central setting large castle makes perfect place for story like take place Lamberto makes best even does involve ripping off superior films times such Infernostyle pool scene plot itself not quite good atmosphere several scenes are drawn out far too long relationship between characters rather strange particularly between husband wife Theres not great deal bloodshed but Bava does get little bit with special effects ogre itself looks really silly good job dont get see very often boil down fitting highly predictable ending overall have say film much better than expected comes recommended
