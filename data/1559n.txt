even worse than original Game Death jumbled incoherent storyline leads Billy falling from helicopter ground below killing him were left follow younger brother Bobby not only start out following some Bruce Lee clone film kills one off follow another one thirty minutes into story main reason watch one when Bobby fights lion which quite obviously guy lion costume Jang Lee Hwang also villain who usually pretty awesome but screen time significantly small Mainly watched original Game Death because theyre part Bruce Lee boxed set wonder theyre included with Lees finished works one would buy them otherwise
