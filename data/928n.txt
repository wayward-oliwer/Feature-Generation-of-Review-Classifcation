With title like above beyond comprehension how movie just did NOT appeal Granted theres few decently sleazy moments little gore but way which movie shot overall storyline just struck idiotic lazy attempt profuse shock tactics inconsistent plot starts with guy raping murdering woman stranded side road abetting brother are imprisoned until brother breaks out arranges meet girlfriend out woods ends forcing her into house where they screw later shows her collection kidnapped guys basement heavily drugged captives consist her old boyfriend who raped her grabby neighbor her sexually abrasive boss explains her kill them all She winds killing HIM then turning her focus towards men pigs whom she tortures kills herself Most violence humiliation with sht eating genitalia destroying all which are far from disturbing essentially mild best scene graphic broom handle masturbation followed some painful manrape Surely Spit Your Corpse Pss Your Grave intended unofficial sequel Spit Your Grave based mainly title reference main character gives suggesting her mother Camille Keaton personally consider wildly blasphemous assertion movie boring amateurish mess strives for shocks but failed miserably
