After watching KHAKEE felt ill get watch another good film but sadly film joke actually trying hard introduce Aryeman Afterall father Keshu producer spoke highly about film during promotions saying film meat unlike films released time wonder which films talking about film actually typical Masala film with loads comedy romance action everything jumbled ease which kids kidnap family one funniest parts ever Imagine kids kidnapping Dawoods family end complete jumble mumble with sudden change characterization gives weakest film till date except some Bachchan scenes film bore Music boring Amitabh tries give role all does part well though not best though contorts face too much when pulling trigger does weird look while smoking cigar dubbing too isnt matched properly times Akshay there for some minutes just repeats act hams Aryeman seems expressionless tries too hard but overdoes some scenes Bhumika emerges best lot rest are okay
