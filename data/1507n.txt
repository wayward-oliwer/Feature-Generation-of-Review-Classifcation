There are some really terrific ideas violent movie executed clearly could have elevated from Spaghettiwestern blandness into something special Unfortunately TOWN CALLED HELL one worst edited movies imaginable Scenes start end abruptly characters leave for long stretches performances accents actors are pretty inconsistent etc Robert Shaw Mexican revolutionary who after taking part wiping out village stays become priestten years later village run mayor Telly Salavas Stella Stevens arrives looking for revenge man who killed her husband Colonel Martin Landau arrives looking for Shaw They all yell each other LOT they all shoot each other LOT Fernando Rey too blind man performances arent bad but they are mightily uneven Savalas accent sometimes does Landau who really grating here Shaw Rey prove they are incapable really embarrassing themselves Stevens looks pretty foxy bit out place amongst sweaty filth
