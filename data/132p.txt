really have disagree with guyyardleyrees who should have watched entire film would have seen some absolutely stunning Scottish scenery some best ever shot Skye found film with difficult start come together into really poignant whole not big budget film Rather film strong community feel cant say how much standard films bore pushing out same polished stuff again again Seachd doesnt seem about all really seems trying offer something more real certainly more Gaelic than any recent Scottish film acting isnt style blockbuster because actors are seemingly real people actually thought key roles boy Grandfather were really convincing times unusually beautiful Seachd really bears second viewing since there are many threads become clearer second time around really feed into ending Overall combination music times stunning visuals plus community approach acting nonnormal structure turned Seachd into quite distinctive memorable film More these please
