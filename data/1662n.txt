Most book adaptations are bad but film left out key parts storyline changed description some characters They rewired storyline combined scenes changed order They ridiculous things into never happened book would never happen hadnt read book beforehand would have been incredibly dull film didnt make you care about characters like them dislike them turns characters into jokes Ridiculous Waste two hours life
