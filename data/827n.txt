There are some Stallone movies like but movie didnt meet low expectations found movie hard believe For example bunch terrorists who crash land wilderness are prepared survive for least two days Also all wilderness Stallone company keep running across bridges ladders provide convenient shortcuts plot devices Also Treasury cops dont seem coordinate anything with local rescue people Also bad guys who couldnt hit side barn with really hightech looking automatic weapons liked John Lithgows villain initially but character such complete psychopath doesnt care all about any own bad guys all them getting killed Eventually just couldnt believe character anymore Not worth price rental not even worth taking time watch
