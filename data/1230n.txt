Having read some good reviews about film thought about time see Well dont know why bothered Basically family entrusted with clue leads whole big stash ancient treasure hidden Knights Templar during War Independence Apparently had kept out hands British all costs Firstly why did said Knights move treasure from Europe America How did Nic Cages character figure out Charlotte fact ship How they figure out all clues riddles about minute how could two people suddenly become master thieves steal what probably best guarded bit paper world These are just some plot holes inane bit Hollywood action gone wrong Cage been some great action movies FaceOff Rock why lowered himself getting too old character pretty annoying really Somehow ordinary guy steals Declaration Independancd outruns thieves with guns escapes from FBI generally seems invincible whole film doesnt really make any sense all all quite disappointment
