thought sequel some sorts meant original from 1983 But sequel not taking original plot destroying actually had very little expectations movie but just wasted minutes life suspense actually feel clairvoyant poor acting filled with technical errors computer geek just couldnt believe They have tried make mix between generic war movie hours But not even worthy low budget movie not see movie complete waste time Instead get original theme still valid Dont let much power into machine acting plot far more exiting compelling
