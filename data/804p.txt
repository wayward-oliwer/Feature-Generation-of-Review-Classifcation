saw movie with dad must have been pretty young around Star Movies one afternoonThe movie started bit vaguely but you could tell those robbers were gathering for score really caught pace after first half hour All actors are great especially Blades Lou Diamond Guess ensemble they just play well together can watch film anytimeI think relative stupidity plot characters trying deal with very weird score jokes are not corny but they are subtle extreme same time make them hilarious perfect comedy for lazy afternoon
