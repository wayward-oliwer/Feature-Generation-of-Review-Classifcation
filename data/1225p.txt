fair expected car chases film There only really one but apart from Freeway great movie which glad own DVD only really big names cast are HOMICIDEs Richard Belzer radio psychiatrist BMovie villain parexcellance Billy Drago Revelationquoting Freeway Killer But rest cast generally give good performances especially liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave her character Sunny bit guts She could have been helpless victim character but she fully rounded she seeks out Drago with help bounty hunter James Russo Russo afraid comes across rather wooden but then again character plays Frank isnt very well fleshed out save for back story Sunny given former commanding officer tone menace kept superbly throughout film atmosphere lonely freeway night with killer prowling length sinister grey sedan excellent way building tension music used underscore film suitably composed dont know why there are some people who hate movie Different strokes for different folks suppose But absolutely enjoyed Freeway can strongly recommend
