What kind documentary about musician fails include single track artist himself Unlike Ray countless other films about music artists half fun theater couch reliving great songs themselves Here all tracks are covers put uninteresting characters these renditions fail capture Cohens slow jazzy style More often covers are badly sung folk versions Yuck interviews are much more with other musicians figures rather than with Cohen himself Only rarely does film feature Cohen reading own work never singing like letters poems etc movie really didnt capture much about artists life story either about development through years huge disappointment for big Cohen fan
