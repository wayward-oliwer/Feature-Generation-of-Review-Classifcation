Maybe isnt fair because only made about halfway through movie One few movies have actually not been able watch due lameness acting terrible camera work terrible plot ridiculous whole movie just unrealistic cheesy For example during coke deal coke just kept loose briefcase expert but think people generally put bag They use same stupid sound effect whenever punch thrown over top crunching sound they use toy guns with dubbed sound effects Worst movie ever
