Little Mermaid one absolute favorite Disney movies sorry say however Disney completely messed when they made sequel Ill admit some good points songs arent bad animation clean clear There some humor sureI dont remember because after watching immediately banned from appearing before eyes again worst point movie plot movie Ariel becomes her father She forbids her daughter near sea out fear just she forbidden near land personally think given her past Ariel would maintain some her headstrong ways not treat her daughter like she herself treated Besides fact Ursula replaced nonscary pathetic sort sea witch underfed forgotten sister who more comical than scary She too some little underling her biddingbut shes not scarier worse than Ursula Ursula spoiled with her believability for badness sea witch joke make matters worse Flounder fat deepvoiced father longer cute guppy all know love Erics voice not even done same actor something always annoys remakesequel voice difference very obvious way felt only reason movie made Disney could catch few fast dollars something hate think about corporation actually really enjoy felt plot lacked imagination know act child following footsteps parent happens but Ariel different what loved much about her She had dream she fell love she made dream come true Until she appeared movie Then she became just like other adults isnt Ariel know dont like her know some children who have enjoyed film know some adults who didnt mind either But for for all you out there who have utmost love for Ariel please dont see movie Ariel know dies within resurrected only for song two one final scene actually isnt bad where she accepts water back againalthough she takes very little part ending regardless
