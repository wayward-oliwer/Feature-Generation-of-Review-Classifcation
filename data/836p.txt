thought pretty good movie should have been released theaters first wouldnt have been big Blockbuster but would have made some pretty good money movie suspense makes you wonder just how much real world Justin Timberlake did good job wasnt expecting Justin Timberlake good job Considering first movie did good job movie good pick watch when you just dont know what you want rent night should pretty well cast great highly recommend everyone checks movie out
