recently rented doc having remembered hearing about from IMDbcom intrigued premise knew very little about either these bands but remember hearing Not You Were Last Junkie Earth Dandy Warhols ages ago enjoying said perspective doc One thing found incredible about film there need have any prior knowledge either these bands director Ondi Timoner wastes time engaging audience familiarizing them with people film quickly became grooved lives both Anton Courtney well their respective bands Brian Jonestown Massacre Dandy Warhols think part what makes doc good what makes Ondi Timoner such master documentarian also loved how story these bands told Most what you see bands tour Both bands start out playing small venues struggling make recording industry Throughout film each band strives remain unique uncontrolled norm However makes two bands similar thus brilliant perspective how two bands feather can such different directions would basically recommend for ANYONE who likes film general You not need have particular love for documentaries either bands appreciation for music helps but music itself takes backseat lovehate relationship between Brian Jonestown Massacre Dandy Warhols
