think time for Seagal quietly into night What have just seen makes all direct video releases last few years look like early smash hits comparison secret bio lab making new kind drug jacks humans adrenaline system point where they become psychopathic killers something Somehow Seagal supposed stop infection end worldor something Seagal also went through hit squads like jellybeans every time look commanding new face kinda got hard follow character development well know Stevens athsma prevent him from yelling top lungs but even why constantly dubbed people who sound nothing like him Usually films plot action sequences can save from total waste time but not even close Like said more horror movie with lot blood shank stabbing rather than straight fighting problem wasnt really scary Seagal looked completely out place because infected people were supposed have speed light movement yet year old 280 Seagal killed them all singlehandedly guess lone highlight movie first minutes where new recruits ask Seagal come strip club with them out
