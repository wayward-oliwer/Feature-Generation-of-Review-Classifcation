First all like tell you into comics anime animation such stuff true everyone own preferences but you can trust movie Ill objective begin with story Follows story line comic books far familiar with them But animation Well not actually terrible but definitely cheap mediocre would lot better they didnt try imitate anime style sticked original comic book style drawings pretend not see rare sloppy effects like fire lightnings you could tell movie made about years ago even more Looks little bit like original Vampire Hunter from 1985 Take look Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for instance years ago they made movie looks hell lot better addition voice talents nothing remarkable music nothing special all all lacks atmosphere watched but cannot tell really enjoyed just does not capture you Theres plenty blood violence but does not impress all May will shocking for someone who never watched more mature oriented animations sees animated blood for first time there anyone around but dont think audience for movie they could add little nudity spice chicks around Lucifer were quite tasty hell have Lady Death herself There are few sexy looks but not enough Instead Bill Browns music think would look better hard rock heavy metal soundtrack All all movie isnt bad but you want something better take original Heavy Metal Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 Ralph Bakshis Fire Ice Wizards maybe course Vampire Hunter Bloodlust
