got say Uma Thurman sexiest woman planet movie uber cute mean uber cute had all sex content most Ivan Reitman comedies have but with something lil extra CHEMISTRY Uma Luke both have awkrawrd but believable chemistry seem transcend each scene Both seem create odd twisted interesting relationship with powerful sexual tension you laugh until you cant feel your face anymore Anna Farris rest supporting cast seem play off each others roles perfectly even Wanda Sykes rather small role will keep you laughing Though these kind comedies arent for everybody but have say went with person doesnt usually enjoy these films laughing like crazy movie certainly not for everyone especially younger children since some moments are little toowell lets say ADULT for younger viewers All all pleasantly surprised movie tough ending found little weak compared rest film out
