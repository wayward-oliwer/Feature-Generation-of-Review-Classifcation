just saw movie have say big waste time girl who played Eva Ellen Fjaestad cant act all She read her lines very unnaturally she had very unnatural facial expression through entire movie Rosanna Munter who played Petra other hand natural She played her part with great perfection SPOILERS story simple weve seen many many times before She breaks finds another she get jealous breaks with other girl they end back together end There were surprises all one knew Eva would break Adam would hook with Petra only thing nobody saw coming Petra told Adam after Eva party She became all serious which side Petra viewers hadnt seen earlier movie told him win Evas heart back which really cute Besides Rosanna Munter there isnt single actor who gives memorable performance mediocre movie with mediocre actors dont recommend
