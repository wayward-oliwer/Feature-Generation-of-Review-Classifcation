Jamie Foxx would ever deliver such wonderful Oscarwinning performance One reasons why impressed with Foxxs performance Ray because from watching hammy obnoxious acting movies like Bait Booty Call would never imagine would ever hold Oscar people told five years ago Jamie Foxx one day win Oscar would laugh right their faces Who knows Maybe better off sticking drama because you watch Bait clearly evident comedy not forte swear Jamie mugs much movie surprised face didnt fall off why does have those stupid voices every chance gets Anyone familiar with comedians like Bob Newhart Steven Wright knows comedy doesnt require loud obnoxious joke funny funny not funny then some crazy accent not make any funnier problem have with some comedians who decide try acting they favor getting laughs over character real life normal people dont always have witty comebacks quips Like Albert Brooks said interview discussing character Taxi Driver important funny your character rather than funny comedian prime example Jamie violating rule nauseatingly scene where mug shots are taken starts posing for photographs like model regular person were thrown jail would really acting goofy while having mug shots taken wouldnt police try scold him There are many scenes like throughout film Another sequence one where Jamie unwittingly phone with villain starts phony Caribbean accent Not funny Not mention Jamie never seems acknowledge timing joke Giving comedic performance requires patience whereas goes straight punchline whether right time for not not even big Mike Epps fan but even performance good comparison Jamies matter fact first time felt somewhat relieved whenever would appear screen Epps same flaws when comes comedy but least chooses more lowkey approach One few bright spots clunker comedy David Morse highly underrated actor mostly known for supporting roles villains seems only actor film concerned with grounding reality However fellow Green Mile star Doug Hutchison disgustingly overthetop villain big surprise considering gave superb performance Green Mile also playing heavy Antoine Fuqua proved directing chops movies like Replacement Killers Training Day Even Bait shows can direct hell action sequence only problem seemed disciplining Jamie Foxx who probably improvised half script with one bad joke after another Unless youre diehard fan Foxx please dont take bait
