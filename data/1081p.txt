very thought Arthur Askey twists your guts dont worry you can still watch love Ghost Train like equally marvellous Back Room Boy film simply too damn good sunk single performance even lead actor Personally love Askey perhaps because into world rather than unreasonably expecting him come into mine which mistake too many people make Ghost Train intensely atmospheric you couldnt conceivably watch without amazed deep dark world transports you immersive way few cheap cheerful flagwavers managed during desperate early film would imagine few people have ever watched just once cast are without exception extraordinarily good perhaps Linden Travers lays bit thick but against backdrop lonely railway station wartime she could hardly play nutter not stand out sad passing lovely Carole Lynne earlier year broke last link had with incredible film now really past but waiting patiently for press play
