found very very difficulty watch after initial minutes film managed stomach 4550 minutes before switching off disgust watching Monster House instead which way great fun story massive holes plot line hugely over stated dull acting especially from Justin TImberlake who should really stick what good looking daft singing like castrato Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable especially when made dance around rock music for apparent reason half way through film after him Timberlake meet Freeman Timberlakes characters seem supposed have some sort fatherson relationship sorts something which simply isnt evident all apart from fact though Freemans character seems have nothing but contempt for ignorant rather stupid character Timberlake never less pulls out all stops help him uncover completely ridiculous cover would take some incredible suspension disbelief give any credit story line which simply absurd blown out all proportion Dont watch film pure waste time
