worst thing TMNT franchise ever spawned kid when came out still thought deuce even though liked original cartoon Theres one scene remember when mafia ape guy explains minions what rhetorical questions are atrocious Many fans hate series for including female turtle but didnt bother much didnt even remember her until read about show recently All all miserably forgettable only okay thing theme song Guilty pleasure they call Nananana ninja
