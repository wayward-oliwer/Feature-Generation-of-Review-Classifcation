Ned Kelly wonderfully made Australian film honouring true Australian hero are taken into world Ned best friend Joe Byrne other members Kelly Gang film explains perhaps justifies Neds actions There exceptional cast present who all give stellar performances which brings film life Great job Heath Orlando Bloom fantastic Joe playing role quiet loyal ladiesman very well swept moment For moment almost believed Gang would win battle Glenrowan alas not Some aspects film are fictional avid Ned Kelly fan supporter slightly disappointed Perhaps also film couldve gone longer cover more Kelly GangsNeds life felt not enough covered Regardless few flaws moving film which stirs all sorts emotions hey assume film would better watch rather than Mick Jagger trying portray Ned
