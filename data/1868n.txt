not terrible movie really Glenn Keitel are topnotch actors Further they acceptable job with very weak script scenery lush plot some interesting twists Further umderstand why these actors crew made film they are professionals they get paid for But wonder why studios spend time money make film then dont release for theater audiences Even film boxoffice flop surely makes some money you are fan Keitel Glenn rent video catch did Granted movie wont help solve immigration quandary with Mexico but experience far better than standard fare today
