saw film tonight NYC Landmark Sunshine didnt know what expect not read much about knew would see matter what All All very well done doesnt focus generalization AntiWar statements which left politics out soldiers mainly spoke their awareness toxicity their training boot camp how hard once they returned civilian life really good see Paul Rieckhoff Camilo Mejia tell about difficulty surviving not only war but refusing command back when against personal morals Make mistake not antiwar film Anyone who says hasnt seen not living with scars war their souls
