agree with most Columbo fans movie unnecessary change format Columbo unique cop with unorthodox police methods movie looks like remake any other ordinary detective dramas from past disturbing point because Columbo ordinary detective There are two parts film left intriguing First cant figure out title movie misleading Maybe better title wouldve been Vanishing Bride something similar Second Columbo hides piece evidence without offering reason viewers least why does dont feel betrayed just disappointed glad Peter Falk went back usual Columbo
