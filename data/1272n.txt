All logic goes straight out train window British horror film set London underground starring usually reliable Franka Potente Run Lola Run Franka plays Kate businesswoman way from office party meet friends who falls asleep underground station only wake find she been locked finds herself chased someone something with killer intentions Plot holes unbelievability are rife there are very few moments are actually jumpy scary but plenty are just plain dull All all unpleasant film should just stay locked underground forever all favour only plus point here inclusion cast popular veteran actor Ken Campbell whos done better than even including Erasmus Microman
