had been looking forward seeing Dreamgirls for quite whilewhat with all raving reviews nominations media attention must say first quarter movie good really portrayed black music scene back then However movie wore whole family were bored out our wits singing just kept coming one after other mean seriously just one more music number would have broke even with RENT Furthermore noticed hardly any character development any characters just didnt care what happened them Even when Eddie Murphys character died drug overdose knew should have been sad but just couldnt feel any emotion for character characters were given flimsy background about singing their childhood whatnot but there personalities were not revealed enough draw Finally conflict simply not significant enough make viewer care which goes along with lack character development movie reminded copycat movie based Ray Chicago Rent Ray Chicago were wonderful movies opinion Overall think movie would best suit someone who doesnt really care about overall story yet would enjoy two hours entertaining fun singing performances
