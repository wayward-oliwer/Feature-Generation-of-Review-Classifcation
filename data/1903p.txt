Steve Carell once again stars light romantic movie about choices family pressure judging plot cover art movie expecting flatout comedy lots laughs unrealistic elements but guess wrong Sure movie had some comedy but felt much more light Drama Steve Carell once again gave great performance movie itself really tackles true observations strong element found But ending felt little bit rushed predictable Throughout cinematography great acting great message delivered obvious but yet still very important Though came down old flat predictable ending reckon different choices were made end movie perhaps for bad even movie would get better publicity Still fun movie
