really like film when started watch thought would get bored pretty soon but surprised thought great film have seen few times now characters are believable have say fell love with Brian Austin Green all over again first time Beverly Hills 90210 would recommend film you are fan but agree with another comment made earlier ending sort disappointing would have loved turn out little different Never mind though good gripping story
