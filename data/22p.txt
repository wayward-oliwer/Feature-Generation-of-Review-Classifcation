Haunted World Edward Wood isnt particularly good documentary Aesthetically lackluster cheap looking people off tangents which make very unfocused incohesive but adds charm say because documentary about oddball made oddball pictures surrounded himself with fellow oddballs such theres really other way document life career man crew misfits There are some glimpses insight into both genius ineptness Wood portrayal both qualities credit genuineness documentary Overall worth watch for Wood fan those cinema general but dont expect brilliance here Expect documentary made after Woods own heart
