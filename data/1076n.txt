Artemesia takes usual story about art world You cant paint But want plasters with sex scandal make whole film well interesting but not remarkable story about one first female painters around Artemesia who course fiercely independent but just cant stop thinking men their bodies for artistic purposes course She soon gets private tutoring from one well known artist but soon tutoring becomes much more then art soon after scandal erupts Funny how they could take historical biography make almost into softporn fantasy mean Artemesia much manhungry person Also quite funny when shes insisting she paints for herself yet falls for first person she sees Actually story itself quite fascinating ends with trial which always love But wasnt too crazy about male lead who played her teacher who looked rather like person someone like wouldnt fall for woulda gone for young fisherman
