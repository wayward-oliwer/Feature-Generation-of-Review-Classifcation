came NEW PORT SOUTH expecting surrogate movie about Columbine school massacre similar Van Sants ELEPHANT certainly synopsis guide stating student sociopath rebels against system did give impression but very boring movie where little happens consider yourself warned story about Maddox Chicago high school student who decides strike back what perceives authoritarian regime major problem character underwritten actor who plays him Blake Shields unable embellish any script deficiencies You have gut feeling Maddox should have evil charisma Hitler Saddam Bin Laden but never comes across anything more than petulant truculent teenager impossible believe could rally any disciples subtext you overthrow one manipulative authoritarian regime only replace with another manipulative regime too obvious which means NEW PORT SOUTH entirely unconvincing drama not worth out your way see
