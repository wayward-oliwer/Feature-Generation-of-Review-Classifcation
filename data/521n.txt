Although have enjoyed Bing Crosby other movies find movie particularly grating Maybe because from different era different country but found Crosbys continual references Good Old USA pleasant first trite after while then finally annoying Dont get wrong not antiAmerican whatsoever but seemed English could right andor needed brave smart American visitor show them way fish out water story but unlike most movies sort time fish who upper hand fair both myself movie have watched few times spaced over few years get same impression each time watched another Crosby movie last night Emperors Waltz too produced same reaction surprise even wife who for whats worth American found your face attitude American Crosby irritating One too many references Teddy Roosevelt she put for premise movie unique enough for day supporting cast course very good scenery music also good are great costumes although agree with previous reviewer wig William Bendix looks horrid picture Moe Three Stooges All all for would much more enjoyable picture without attitude Bing Crosby but because virtually every shot pretty hard sit through movie
