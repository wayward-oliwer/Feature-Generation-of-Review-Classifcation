cant understand why they decided release film introduce American audience dynamo Jet Fist Legend would have been much better choice Anyway Black Mask isnt terrible but certainly isnt great either final fight sequence well staged Yuen Woo Ping who went coordinate Matrix But English release suffers from rough editing dubbing begging Hollywood studios release these films uncut with subtitlesJet shows characteristic charisma title role Francoise Yip cool but brief role female 701 Black Mask strange goth style adds some interest but overloaded with gun battles explosions More focus fantastic physical skills were order Black Mask decent film but yourself favor pick Fist Legend you want see tremendous film really shows skills
