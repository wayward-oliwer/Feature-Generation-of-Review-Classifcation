decent endeavor but guy who wrote screenplay seems bit dark what exactly makes zombie movie cool isnt CGI bugs software companies Actually not sure whether software company saw without subtitles had guess what theyre talking about Anyway point instead wasting your time animating some dumbass bug why not throw more zombies more action minutes consist news bulletins bugs some guys yelling about something makes matters worse more boring most deaths occur offscreen realize all too common for nobudget movies but then there were some very impressive effects well kinda which left wondering why did director screenwriter whatever chose focus how epidemic started short nobodys gonna care anyway
