One best not best rocknroll movies ever not just mindless fun There really were lot clever jokes course love Ramones But with all anarchy hate high school themes film doesnt all take itself too seriouslywhich whats great about first saw movie Spring 1980 saw again recently Since went high school late 1970s made kind nostalgic Like said film doesnt take itself seriously isnt pretentious like much other teen fare seventies eighties nineties speak not really dirty disgusting either Only rated rare for movie category great cult classic truly incredible time capsule
