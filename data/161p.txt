First off must say made mistake watching Election films out sequence say unfortunately because after seeing Election first Election seems bit disappointment Both films are gangster epics are similar form while Election enjoyable piece cinema just not nearly good sequel first Election installment are shown two competitors for Chairman Big Lok After few scenes discussion amongst Uncles who should have Chairman title they almost unanimously decide Lok Simon Yam will helm Triads Suffice say doesnt over very well with competitor Big Tony Leung Fai bid influence takeover Big kidnaps two uncles order sway election board side disastrous results heads triads into all out war Lok determined become Chairman but wont become official until can recover Dragon Head Baton material representation Chairmans power current Chairman Whistle Chung Wang hidden baton somewhere mainland China race see who can recover first Much film devoted recovery Baton both aspiring leaders search for they must dodge cops opposite sides which leads into one stand out scenes Election which involves underling named Jet Nick Cheung machete lots bad guys Nick Cheungs presence attention grabbing say least wonder influenced director Johhnie any way while making second Election does deliver more Jets character sequel While Nick Cheung gives scene stealing performance must not fail give due rest films actors Election great ensemble cast with well thought out performances are both subtle impacting Simon Yam usually glorious self film also benefits from heavyweight actors like Louis Koo Tony Leung Fai underappreciated Suet Lam There really arent any weak links acting one could easily believe theyre watching real gangsters Although performances are great one most impressive things about Election Johnnie eye for camera There are some truly striking shots film goes without saying definitely knows how frame shots viewer treated series innovative quite brilliant camera placings angles All which makes Election above all great looking film issues with film arises mostly out shear amount characters involved Election gets bit hard follow because film full characters arent integral plot While sequel opts focus more two candidates first Election offers election process whole with tons Uncles underlings police officers crowding storyline Maybe film would have worked better would have been bit longer with more time dedicated inner workings Triad Director Johnnie would have funneled down necessary elements expounded them more Bottom Line All all wonderfully brutal film with great cast excellent direction leisurely pacing packs punch just little more complicated than needed
