got lured title expecting insightful intriguing journey into alcoholism instead got rather boring uninspiring story about rowdy Scot leading character isnt given much psychological depth unless you are willing classify cheesy teenlike poetry psychology shame because core story could have been good with better effort depict inner feelings man who had live with alcohol violence since youth Sadly general idea seems more like way because way laughingly bad attempt giving some sort poetic edge lowerclass man makes things even worse Resorting overused cliché poète maudit reeks quick fix cheap way make dull movie seem smart artsy meaningful But years alcohol isnt much smart artsy meaningful leading character doesnt evolve all feeble attempt changing fails without good explanation Just like initial attempt happened rather out blue movie borrows heavily from classics such Clockwork Orange Trainspotting but ultimately fails recapture their greatness not even for few seconds Jobson put too much emphasis artistic side story neglected rest giving movie which pleasant eye but insipid brain
