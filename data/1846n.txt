found movie horror section video store seems make sense most zombie movies have their place there From Romeros Dead trilogy days later However upon watching you can quickly see what movie really actually music video goes progressively faster gets more more more gory There horror here folks Just some halfway decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last last last soon you get feeling maybe youre DVD player accidentally skipped back minutes but how they actually made movie pity think anyone could find better use for million dollars movie industry than make lump crud Though some 360 effects were cool but once again they were over used grew tedious since same stunt over over again each time just with different character Also what ROYALLY annoying splicing footage from arcade game Ive played game sucks why did they put here right isnt movie but music video poor one 310 Rated lot violencegore profanity
