main reason wanted see movie because wonderful cast ton favorite actors one movie equals amazing with out actually seeing But movie caught off guard wasnt what expecting all been while since Ive seen but remember could not stop laughing wasnt just cast did for script amazingly written Every time you were expecting something happen didnt happen There were many twists turns but fit with whole tone movie instead coming off pretentious cinematography along with set absolutely beautiful well really cant say anything bad about movie Expcept would have Andrew Davoli little more screen time
