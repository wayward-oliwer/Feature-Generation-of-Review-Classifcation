Had checked IMDb BEFORE renting DVD from Netflix have couple hours life back frankly suspicious when see films director also wrote case according credits same guy writter director unfortunately indication overall quality production There were few interesting moments Judy Tenutas scene reminded her early comedy routines touting Judyism which led rate two stars rather than one Those moments however were few far between almost did not get see them because opening sequence nearly incomprehensible not mention reprehensible violence admit went back watch part again see had missed something would help figure out once seen whole thing Nope though least recognized who characters were who would turn out important later spinning camera technique overused essentially pointless found myself talking screen What For goodness sake get with Not recommended
