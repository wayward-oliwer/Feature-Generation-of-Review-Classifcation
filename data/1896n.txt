cast although nothing special all job story seems like good idea script bearable end quite good twist whats wrong with For start special effects are really bad made might look but 2003 there just excuse for visuals poor makes laugh DVD cover claims very proudly from special effects creator Jeepers Creepers Secondly direction weak film just does not capture essence story doctor feeding hospital inmates souls Devil demon type creature should tense frightening simply isnt All all pretty poor film although bearable times mildly entertaining still probably best left alone rather sad 410
