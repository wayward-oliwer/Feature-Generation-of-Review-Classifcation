wanted like Magnolia plot reminded Grand Canyon which liked different livesstories come together end but Magnolia took wrong turn halfway through movie lost almost turned off right then there but felt should hang there until end little did know would another torturous hours Thank god rented instead seeing theatre almost screamed out frustration after hours biggest kick pants ending frog scene DVD player still hasnt forgiven dont blame one bit unique movie but bad boring pointless movie
