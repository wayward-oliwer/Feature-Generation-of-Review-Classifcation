show had lot hype but didnt know about until midseason season Someone even recommended show But decided watch wait until end season could watch bulk Due shows format happy waited imagine would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end middle some cliff hanger then have wait another week find out what happens next second story Somehow show managed throw too much sex Jason will have sex with pretty much anything moves Right after finds out one woman had sex with killed bed with another woman next night Then Tara Sam get despite each them knowing Sam love with Sookie for some reason Sookie gets mad when she later finds out about iteven though shes sleeping with vampire One problems with show doesnt good job making you care about characters really didnt care for Jason all Along with endless pursuit tale rude people who actually were concerned for him After few episodes wouldnt have minded got killed somehow For reason for most part uninterested murders until Sookies Grandmother became victim since first two were more closely involved with Jason Then once Sookie Bill have sex story gets few more subplots Taras mother wants exorcism then exorcist lady tries convince Tara she should have one remove her own demon wasnt much bothered whole exorcism thing know there are some people who really believe stuff However they waste little time showing farce right after Tara spends about 1300 exorcisms for her her mother other points some developments happen too fast Jason continues jerk trying sell Grandmothers stuff buy vampire blood which apparently new crack something search finds girl who will vampire blood with him They get high within three days fall love with each other kidnap vampire for constant source Another example when Bill vampire tribunal only gone for two days before Sookie starts feel abandoned start wonder thinks vampire politics are more important than her Subtlety not shows strong suit doesnt take genius figure out something with local dog Although assumption wasnt dead wasnt much surprise But finale two episodes where really got annoying just shoved all developments your face you couldnt possibly figure out for yourself When Tara gets into car accident naked ladys face with pig clearly shown easily recognizable when she shows jail for bailout wasnt enough they later show lady again with pig her house Then time wrap murder story end penultimate episode revealed Renee not who says most likely killer final episode they shove Renee killer your face Sookie remarks odd Renees thoughts dont have accent thought fine adds Renee fraud But next scene full incriminating evidence against Renee They show Renee tape Maudette with vampire fianc√©e finds tape one Renees boxes about how fake Cajun accent point just ridiculous mean GET blah blah blah stuff happens Bill almost kills himself while failing save Sookie who still manages kill Renee They start set season leaving unfinished issues naked pig lady Sam have history Lafayette gone missing might have been killed Jason process brainwashed into religious nut some antivampire churchwhich makes care about him even less almost surprising see how many people absolutely love show think just expected show better interested seeing what happens season but watch Ill most likely wait for season completion
