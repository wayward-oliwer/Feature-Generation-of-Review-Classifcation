really looking forward too seeing movie been advertised mustsee movie for people love movies about nature movie shows different climates animals associated with them starting North Pole down south movie progresses footage from movie often breathtakingly beautiful many times wondered how Earth they could have taken some shots under water sky However beautiful large part footage had already seen series Planet Earth narrated David Attenborough found Attenboroughs narration Planet Earth much better than narration Earth Earth easier movie skips much scientific detail Attenborough covers Planet Earth series For instance Earth will tell you tropical sea ideal nursery for young humpback whale because there are few predators Planet Earth will tell you tropical sea good nursery because water low oxygen doesnt contain enough nutrients support very large animals like large sharks etc important difference together with Attanboroughs far superior voice make Planet Earth far better documentary than Earth Still however think Earth worth watching for beautiful footage fact easier understand makes interesting for children too
