appreciate need hire unknowns for these kind horror movies but they should least hire some proper actors sergeant especially guilty using monotone bulldozer every single line But lets face lines arent really important There isnt really recognisable plot most writing involves words mfr other assorted bad language place proper dialogue story mostly made seemingly random gore death with couple cringeworthy surprises which happen around minutes after you see exactly whats happen Not only but there are several glaring plot holes continuity errors Why are they there Didnt have weapon Wasnt dead makes whole film seem been cut down several hours would take fix them Another film which simply relies blood gore instead any real cinematic experience
