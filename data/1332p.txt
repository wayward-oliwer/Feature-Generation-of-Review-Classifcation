Granted had seen some Speed Racer but never really watched had also seen other shows some featuring these characters dressed birds who flew ship called Phoenix another revolving around space ship looked like giant ocean vessel flew backwards times for some reason really dark hard understand for someone who maybe five one though watched nearly every episode amazing time show had some resolution actually ended bad guys done unlike nearly every American cartoon where nothing really concludes such last episode generation one Transformers ended with Galvatron new bad guy vowing get Autobots Dungeons Dragons with kids never making home with Joe with Cobra still out there ready try again forth one did end did feature rather cool robot got new weapons show progressed bit bland begin with could not fly had only few really cool weapons went got cool shooting fist like one Android used against Cell Dragonball then weapon evolved include razors shot out Then big robot even got wings could fly even more weapons were incorporated into wings would also get couple allies female robot rather funny one called Bobo America villains not only consisted Hell but really weird person half man half woman dude with flying head Interesting show kind nice seeing conclusion
