When movie first shown television had high hopes would finally have decent movie about World War experienced American soldiers Unfortunately not should have been good movie about WWI Even though made for television obvious real effort made use appropriate equipment props But writing directing are badly lacking even though makers movie obviously borrowed freely from quite few well made war movies War movie clich√©s abound such arrogant general who apparently does not care flip about lives men When will Hollywood realize even though there have been plenty bad generals most combat unit generals have seen plenty combat themselves are not naive about what average grunt experiences first part movie appeared Paths Glory with American uniforms Except Paths Glory emotionally gripping Later there Chamberlains charge except uphill from Gettysburg even capture American soldier ring enemy soldiers from Thin Red Line But Thin Red Line soldier alone when captured movie ring forms around new prisoner middle battle movie used military adviser they ignored him Even though actors never could forget they were actors while watching mouthed military tactics didnt see very much American soldiers would stand shot while Germans attacked infamous Storm Troopers who were apparently blind appeared use tactics whatsoever their attack real war tactics were what made storm troopers effective But silliest scene attack German Flamethrowers scene German flamethrower operators walked broad line towards defending Americans had been real they would never have gotten close enough use their flamethrowers before they had all been dropped defenders bullets Okay most war movies are unrealistic when comes tactics shown But still disappointing But what really turned off flick typical antiwar antimilitary angle movie makers seem think important True war hell But most American soldiers even though they grumble gripe tend believe what they are can rather gungho about Grandfather served World War even though died four years before born have been told how proud service
