Domino actually breath fresh air something new cinema world enjoyed movie lot because intricate plot varied characters intense camera effects Ive seen some complain about camera work fact according creators themselves flashy wild shots were all culmination mistakes made through time All what you see desired effect Perhaps some complain because something quite like never been done before although what sets apart deeper aspect what you are seeing just how Domino sees things through her eyes think about When comes story dont see anything quite bad about Despite messy nature according some fact just rapid form storytelling plot really isnt all hard follow you actually focus whats Maybe just because see movies from many different aspects such acting plot etc interpreter anything who picks movies apart just comes With said believe quite excellent movie indeed despite future cultclassic blockbuster whatever characters well theres doubting how varied cast believe cast excellent they all fine jobs portraying their characters effectively what makes movie ladies gentlemen characters are all very unique plus you get witness small piece each one their lives setting them apart even further Basically personally loved cast characters All those who bash burn film perhaps just dont see just doesnt appeal them matter great film own right great film period
