Shot impossible schedule budget speak movie turned out lot better than you would expect certainly much more true Peter ODonnell books comic strip than previous two films You can read strip currently reprints from Titan Books Comics Revue monthly one greatest adventure comic strips all time movie isnt great but unlike most low budget films makes most what got holds your interest DVD extras interview with Quentin Tarentino who obviously stoned Some people have faulted Tarentino for associating name with film but without him would never have been made Modesty Blaise fan picked good writer director All things considered worth stars
