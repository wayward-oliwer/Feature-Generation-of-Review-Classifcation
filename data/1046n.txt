one worst movies Ive ever seen saw premiere SXSW extremely disappointed director knew little about John Lennon even said much premiere drama but people were laughing throughout how cheesy film never good sign only saving graces were Dominic Monaghan Jason Leonard Liviens roommatesbandmates They were funny while rest movie took itself waaay too seriously cheesy dropping Beatles lyrics just absurd soundtrack excellent however probably best part movie Unless youre one those crazy rabid Dominic Monaghan fans dont bother with one
