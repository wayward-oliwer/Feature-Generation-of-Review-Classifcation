anthology always risky business think endeavor should praised Theres lot talent involved here great many talented actors directors writers Unfortunately couldnt really enjoy movie based three issues had First all segments vary incredibly tone quality unfortunately some them clash with others Secondly several segments feel underdeveloped Like seeds good stories never come fruition not talking about happy endings here even ending period but rather they lack even basic development even solid setups draw you Last but not least did not feel NewYork inhabitants were properly portrayed What youre left with highbrow short films may still interest some but will leave average viewer unsatisfied
