pretty average scifi film plot more less obvious from start Although acting reasonably good writing seemed very cliched using ideas taken from numerous films basic plot Scientists working deep space research platform rescue fighter from crashing into red dwarf they have been orbitting Onboard they find stasis pod which coincidently malfunctions very moment After minutes man pod waking you realise complete lunatic Something which totally escapes person crew research ship After becomes rip off every other film involving psychotic madman terrorising innocent victims overall think Speed better exploration subject matter which didnt consider good film either Not good film get Aliens out watch again
