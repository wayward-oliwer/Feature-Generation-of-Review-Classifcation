Now look wont lie you but only got movie for 399 from friend because had Danni Filth lead singer ever popular death metal band Cradle Filth expected course violence gore finest what Filth can portrayed amongst plot line But dear god wrong movie seriously bites big time low budget film haha wait make ZERO BUDGET obviously lacks beautiful Howard Stern orchestra musical scores Spielberg special effects Nope all one camera bad angles bad blood scenes Take for example when our star violent fiend Filth violently kills mugger grab throat blood spits out but looks like theres juice packet filled with fake blood mans shirt you Cradle Filth fans Youll hear two songs throughout movie but with camera angles shoddy filming they drag overall pleasure song DOWN final comment Steer well away from blood gore breasts hey even shoddy story with you like appalling violence near voices theres hardly any words movie then all means buy But shoddy movies isnt your thing then avoid Dont waste your money
