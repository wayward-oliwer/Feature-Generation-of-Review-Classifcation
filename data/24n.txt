just watched movie Starz Let through few things thought could have been improved acting writing directing special effects camera crew sound lighting also seemed though writers had idea anything had with movie Apparently back 2007 when dollar stronger you could buy super advanced stealth bomber could completely invisible for million Nowadays those things cost about billion they cant invisible Apparently you can fly from middle east hour There completely random lesbian scene which didnt mind but seemed like lame attempt get more guys see camera would randomly zoom actors skip random scenes yeah since Steven Segal movie predictable hell All all rank right there with Snakes Plane
