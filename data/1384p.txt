just came back from prerelease viewing excellent scifi film noire style definitively unique very well made filmed with actual actors but transformed into black white comicstrip style you have never seen before goes one step further than Sin City does well successful combination french comic movie cultures story mood remind Blade Runner you liked one you will surely like one too storyline intelligent never boring some nice little twists film mustsee for any cinephile except perhaps those who absolutely dont like scifi
