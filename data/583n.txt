Bottom barrel unimaginative practically unwatchable remake ROAD WARRIOR film follows exact plot Filipino film STRYKER worse far Bad acting dialog effects dubbing pacing action sequences list goes Italy made literally dozens Road Warrior ripoffs early some good some bad worst far contest Not only mood film completely bleak miserable experience sitting through one bore half There one good chase sequence towards beginning movie cool shot man holding hand grenade exploding But EVERYTHING else about movie seriously reeks For actual postnuke fun track down copy ENDGAME AFTER FALL NEW YORK ESCAPE FROM BRONX instead Theyre much more enjoyable than rubbish
