great example rather simple Film Noir story handled exceptionally wellthanks excellent direction Otto Preminger well some lovely acting performances Dana Andrews stars hotheaded detective who all too often uses fists instead brains Soon after film begins Andrews reprimanded for warned continues hell off force bit later while investigating crime attacked suspect Andrews forced fight protect himself time does NOT use excessive force but assailant killed Andrews panics assumes they wont believe him tries cover deaththough instead innocent man ultimately blamed for crime Theres lot more film than thisincluding plot involving slimy villain Gary Merrill love interest for Andrews Gene Tierney All all one better examples genrewith great gritty dialog superb lighting simple yet very effective story way Noir meant
