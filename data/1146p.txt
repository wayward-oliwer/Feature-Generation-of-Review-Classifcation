sought film out because new Frain fan wanted see more work First all Irish accent great got keen ear for dialects seems acting marvelous usual James Frain aside thought film very well done showed conflict Northern Ireland mess really Both sides are guilty grave injustices men drawn into conflict usually have very little say about their circumstances Also interesting realise not every man woman supposedly fighting for country really just For example when Kenny James Frain asks Ginger Ian Hart why does Ginger cant come with morally acceptable answer Why Because Ginger isnt for noble cause protecting country rights fellow ProtestantsGinger for fun killing full bloodlust perfect job for guy like him struggle like there are guys like Liam John Lynch who just want live their daily lives enjoy their familiesguys see all fighting just begats more fighting There are guys like Kenny are born leaders full charisma they add fuel flames rather they mean not Also Kenny genuinely believes cause believes what will make difference futurewhich bit odd cause character seems too intelligent for all But like lot other seemingly intelligent men sucked into gang lifestyle not even realizing ittil too late Then there Ginger pure psycho who isnt fighting for any other reason but for sheer thrill which gangland type war makes him valued asset some might argue However now film Ginger out lasted worth become very dangerous loose cannon Everything comes boiling point predictably ending tragic one What makes film worthy shows both sides ages old conflict American cant begin fully understand what all struggle about But know there better way All all well acted touchingbut troubling film
