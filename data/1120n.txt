Burt Reynolds came point career where appeared just thru motions Hed show party with friends film take home big paycheck didnt seem matter him product representing pure crap film epitomized more than Stroker Ace which makes Cannonball Run look like classic Cannonball Run look watchable Save for few race scenes there absolutely NOTHING worth seeing here Even beautiful Loni Anderson hams bad dumb blonde embarrassing thought Burt hamming with Jim Nabors dressing like chicken sounds funny then your movie Otherwise pick almost any other film comedy wont any worse
