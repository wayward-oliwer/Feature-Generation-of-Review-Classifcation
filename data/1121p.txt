saw movie Hallmark Channel thought wonderful especially since based true man Pierce Brosnan very good loner English man who took persona half breed Grey Owl photography beautiful movie made more research into character Archie Belaney known simple Grey Owl want read much can about him time did not know Richard Attenborough had directed But not surprised like all movies whether acting directing gave highest rating However would have liked have seen more movie about WHY took persona only showed two aunts who raised him room their house You cant wrong with movie you are like enjoy beautiful story without hearing foul language contrived special effects every few minutes
