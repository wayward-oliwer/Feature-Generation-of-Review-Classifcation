disappointed Reiser who wrote film felt need use much profanity for reason whatsoever Maybe idea adult films plenty nasty words with bathroom humor thrown thought better him think less him for movie Falks acting some moments humor well some possibly important themes are what made give such high rating might good movie for adult children watch laugh over about their own folks their foibles But lack consideration for audience families seriously detriments what could have been family film but fails Certainly not worth spending money though might worth watch for free television
