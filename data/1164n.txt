CRIMSON RIVERS one most overdirected overthetop overeverything mess Ive ever seen come out France Theres nothing worse than French production trying outdo films made Hollywood perfect example such wannabe horroractionbuddy flick almost stopped halfway through because knew wouldnt amount anything but French guys trying showoff film starts off promisingly like some sort expansive horror film but quickly shifts genres from horror action xfiles type buddy flick end all also none full clich√©s one point thought whole thing comedy painful dialogue those silent pauses with fades outs fades just right expositionary moments made groan thought only films made Hollywood used hackneyed technique chase scene with Vincent Cassel running after killer overdirected overdone almost thing beauty climax top mountain with stupid revelation about killers with Cassel Reno playing buddies like Nolte Murphy completely derailed what little credibility film had then difficult believe director CRIMSON RIVERS also directed GOTHIKA which though had share problems doesnt even come close overbaked confused film
