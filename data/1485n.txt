Okay went into movie not really expecting much figured action flick similar Fast Furious Some nice cars some nice girls somewhat decent plot Unfortunately would have say probably worst movie have seen year Dont get wrong cars were nice girls were but way they put movie together just plain crappy put nicely story just never made you care about cast movie seemed just pieced together overall movie not worst thing ever far but your looking for movie weekend would pass one for now
