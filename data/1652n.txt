one worst horror movies have ever seen Unfortunately horror movie buff will rent any horror movie unless not made for When looking box says rated for gore some language Where gore their one good death scene where you actually saw gore could have overlooked there had been some brief nudity some good dialogue There wasnt even one remotely witty amusing line lame movie Sometimes horror movies are awesome because they are stupid but just sad
