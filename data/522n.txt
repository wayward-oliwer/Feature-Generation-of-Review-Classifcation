movie madeforTV taking into account not rip into hard would feature film script subpar but does succeed mildly humorous spots whether means not acting mostly overthetop but true for many lowerbudget movies aspect movie really hated though 9095 shot film but random places there will 510 seconds where footage shot video You can tell because there less contrast colors are less vivid footage clearly frames per second instead films frames per second not sure maybe these scenes had shot later time they didnt have money shoot film assume why anyway but disorienting really makes film look shoddier than had look Anyway Ive definitely seen worse movies but definitely wouldnt say enjoyed movie cant recommend anyone see
