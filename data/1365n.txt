wasnt entirely sure what expect from Comedy Drama Fantasy SciFi genre but given actors involved thought give spin tone film felt awkward through patches each genres but never quite felt balanced eventually gave trying concentrated cinematography individual performances which thought were good whole considering each character had little depth because nature story wont give anything away here have say felt LOT longer than minute runtime not good way end looking for closure some measure satisfaction but didnt turn out clever ingenious piece had hoped would think Tony mistakenly thought what did end film gave but tragic mistake try validate previous minutes with illconceived conclusion Ultimately feel cheated IMO would have been better let stand without ending piece Art just may have missed point completely
