one few episodes not only one with indisputable error storytelling While handling Ralphie situation Christopher states heard about PieOMys death fire accident important detail because context quite obvious Christopher knows from beginning Tony one who must have killed Ralphie There however way Chris could have heard about accident Who should have told him when time torn out delirium Tonys call nobody else informed Tony knows which makes even worse Hearing Christopher talk about Pie OMys death could therefore only lead Tony conclusion Chris himself set fire Given impressively elaborate writing process told writers themselves DVD really wonder none them realized problem there story just doesnt work way Unnecessary add huge fan Sopranos Otherwise certainly wouldnt care
