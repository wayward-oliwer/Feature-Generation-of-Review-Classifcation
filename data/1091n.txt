quite possibly worst film Ive ever seen plot didnt make whole lot sense acting big fan Amber Benson think shes usually wonderful actress cant imagine why she decided film Her character Piper drunk for almost whole film with exception opening scene plus side there several points film where acting bad actually laughed out loud But despite would not recommend film anyone only minutes long but minutes your life you will have completely wasted
