found most enjoyable Muppets movie because felt most lighthearted had best comic delivery most lines Muppets try Broadway sell original musical theyve written but along way they run into usual problems including Kermits memory loss here While there arent many great cameos here original Muppets Movie there are some including Joan Rivers Dabney Coleman Simply timing delivery many lines great situations Muppets find themselves are hilarious original songs are also good here ending satisfying There not much else say about film but Muppet fans should see for sure funniest Muppet movie sure enjoyed all out
