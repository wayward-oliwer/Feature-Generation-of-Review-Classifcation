loved Batman series really looking forward But they tried too much Why they had story Adam West Burt Ward trying recover batmobile beyond dont want knock Burt Adam for way they look nowIts been years since they appeared Batman Robin but see them dressed dress suits fighting badguys kinda sad would rather just seen exstars commentary batmobile side story stupid for flashback movie think too short left out way too much really just quick overview opinion like more background They showed Penguin Joker for about minute each just tell same stuff already knew Joker had mustache under makeup penguin had smoke even though hated exsmoker those love read book sure more showed Like why there Riddlers why Catwomans Mister Freezes Where Commishioner Gordon Cheif OHara Alfred Mister Freeze King Tut etc List goes Like said even ones were one were barely Very disappointing really corny
