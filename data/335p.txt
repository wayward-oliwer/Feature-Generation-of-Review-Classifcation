movie just great you have chance see then you should run see even though movie almost nothing with original from 1932 Pacino does great job playing Tony Montana get around Pacino way about him where can say anything anyway make sound just great you thought Pulp Fiction good with swear words you saw then you should also see Scarface see another angle how actor can say them quite sweet even though movie lot action plot moves very fast through time not keeping realtime aspect ratio correct still easy follow along but you must keep your eyes peeled all times not lose anything personally have found watching movie makes three hours seem like breeze really just great movie one thoe movies acted directed well not only you forget movie made crappy but makes you actually root for bad guy say good night BAD guy
