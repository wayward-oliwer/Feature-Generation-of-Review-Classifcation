not saying because production values were low but because filmed terribly shot girl washing her hair creek Did really need sit there for overlong shot watch her for minutes same spot terrible lighting just plain bad You could barely see anything when characters were talking you could barely hear what they were saying Did watch whole movie course not skipped through most dont want hear anyone say need watch whole thing first judge film poorly done executed even independent low budget standards just plain terrible moviedont waste any time unless you want good laugh but even then not because actors funny lines because how painstakingly bad production
